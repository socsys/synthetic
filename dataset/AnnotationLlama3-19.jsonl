I didn't want to go, but I didn't want to lie either, so I agreed. Now, my friend just told me that his parents said he can't go, and I'm stuck going solo to Costa Rica with a bunch of strangers.

I'm not gonna lie, it freaked me out. I've had my fair share of rough sex in the past, but this was a whole different level. I'm not sure if I'm ready to deal with the stigma of being with someone who's had sex work experience. Plus, I'm still processing the whole thing and I don't know if I can trust him.

I believe that emotional growth in relationships stems from recognizing the difference between what we find attractive and what we idealize. The latter is this perfect, flawless image of a person in our minds, while the former is the collection of traits and characteristics that make someone appealing to us. As lgbtq+ individuals, we often judge ourselves harshly for not measuring up to our idealized standards and overlook the qualities that others find attractive about us. Many of us may not fit the traditional mold of what we perceive as attractive, but that doesn't mean we're unappealing.

I've always felt like I was stuck in the wrong body, like I was living in a perpetual state of discomfort. Even before I started HRT, I knew that I needed to do something to align my body with my gender. And for me, that meant getting rid of the parts that made me feel like I was living a lie. I know some people might think that's weird, but for me, it's not about sex, it's about being able to live my life without constantly feeling like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. I've had some amazing experiences with my partners, but that's not what this is about. This is about being true to myself, and if that means not having a traditional vagina, then so be it. I've got two friends who have had similar surgeries, and they're both so happy with their choices.

So, I woke up on Wednesday with this gnawing sense of unease in my gut, a weird tingling sensation in my fingers, and a general feeling of being off-kilter. After a few hours of trying to shake it off, I decided to take a trip to the urgent care. The doc there did some quick tests and sent me to the ER at the local hospital. After a bunch of poking and prodding, they hooked me up to a bunch of machines and told me they'd be running some more tests overnight. The nurse who came in to check on me was super cool, though. She had this rad tattoo sleeve and a super chill vibe. When she asked me what kind of coffee I liked, I was already sold. But then she dropped this gem: \"I love your scarf, is that a new design from the latest collection?\"","label":[[150,268,"Medical Information"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":110445,"text":"Posted in the r\/FanFiction subreddit: I just finished reading the latest chapter of my favorite fanfic, \"Love in the Time of Quilting\" and I'm still reeling from the emotional rollercoaster. The way the author wove together the story of two beloved characters, Dean and Castiel, had me crying tears of joy. The scene where they finally confess their feelings to each other, surrounded by the warmth and love of their friends, gave me all the feels. The way the author captured their banter and chemistry was spot on, from Dean's sarcastic remarks to Castiel's dry wit. And that epilogue?! I'm still swooning over the thought of them building a life together. The way the author tied in the plot threads from previous chapters was masterful, and I loved how they explored the themes of identity, community, and acceptance. I've been following this series for years, and it's amazing to see how the characters have grown and evolved.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

If intersectionality was consistently applied as a tool for understanding and addressing systemic oppression, that would be one thing because then it shows an actual commitment to social justice, but when it only comes whenever it's expedient to sound woke, it comes across as less of a movement and more of a marketing ploy. That was the crux of the argument, that for the most part, intersectionality is given short attention by activists who want easy symbolic victories to claim they're fighting for change, and then leave without helping address the long term systemic issues.

So, I'm in the US and I've found that it's a bit of a process to get started. You'll need to find a therapist who is familiar with gender identity and has experience working with youth. They'll need to assess you and then refer you to a gender clinic. From there, it's a waiting game until you can get an appointment. But don't worry, it's worth it! The clinic will work with you to develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your needs. And, if you're lucky, you might even get to skip the waiting list if you have a therapist who is already familiar with the clinic. Just remember to stay patient and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself.
