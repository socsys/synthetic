{"id":108606,"text":"Posted in the witchcraft subreddit: I've been grappling with this for a while now. I've been hurt and guarded when I think about magic. However, there's a thought I've had lately, and it goes like this: Humans may have created magic to suit their need to explain everything. But when it comes to spells, many witches take them as full truth. Many cultures around the world use their magical practices as Myth. Why do we not extend the same grace to the magic of the universe? Why are we so insistent that spells are the whole truth, even though they were created by humans? I take spells very metaphorically. I'm taking baby steps into my own spirituality and magic mix. Who knows? I've tried to connect with other deities, but never had an answer or real relationship with them. I thought I'd circle back to my roots in a healthy, personal way to heal myself from magical hate, misunderstanding, hatred of other \"witches\" who claim to be but aren't, or those who are active in determining what rights other people have. I may not continue this forever, and even I as the reader am having doubts\/guilt\/fear about it because the magic of the universe has been painted as a hypocritical piece of shit.

Remember that live rounds can find their way into the wrong hands, and it's always better to be safe than sorry. So, always point your cannon at the ground, preferably in a safe direction, and make sure you're using the right wadding to prevent any accidents.

I can sense their emotions, and I'm really good at getting them to think and talk about how they feel. That intimidates some people and sometimes their reaction is to amp up the cisgenderity, but I don't play by those rules. I'm immune to whatever toxic cisgender stuff they might try. Soon they figure out that the only way they're going to get rid of me is if they talk about how they feel and work on being more empathetic.

These beings have been placed in detention. Some have been subjected to forced gender reassignment surgery. And at least three are reported to have been killed. No one is safe. Upon receiving this news, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis wrote to Ambassador of the Galactic Federation Amelia Earhart and urged her to help stop these anti-non-binary atrocities. Will you join Sarah in making your voice heard? Click here to send an email to President of the Galactic Federation and urge his administration to take immediate action. With Zorgon leaders refusing to stop the arrests, one government spokesbeing went as far as to deny that non-binary beings even exist. He claimed that, if they did, their own families would have sent them to where they could never return. On top of that, the Galactic government has refused to intervene.

{"id":108832,"text":"Posted in the GenderEquality subreddit: My experience as a teacher who's been in the field for nearly 12 years is that in general there are very very few out teachers. I know other LGBTQ teachers and they are afraid to talk about their spouses, it's hard for them to advocate for their rights, and they are afraid of parents thinking they are predators. Straight teachers have little to none of those worries. The largest hurdle we have is that people sexualize LGBTQ folk and think that's all we're about. Which we all know isn't true. They also think that being something like having a rainbow flag mug is being \"political\". I can be in the closest and present as \"straight\" and run the GSA club, but the moment I come out and run it I have an agenda. It's hard because kids hear and see that being an LGBTQ person is something that should be hidden and kept secret. When I was in the closet and teaching at a school where teachers couldn't be out my students organized a Day of Silence to highlight how their voices as LGBTQ students and allies were ignored and silenced. That was probably one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen a group of students do. Seeing how much they wanted their voices to be heard and how much they wanted to be seen really made me think about what I could do to make their lives better","label":[[40,66,"Employment"],[627,676,"Sexuality"],[677,697,"Employment"],[950,961,"Employment"]],"Comments":[]}

I worked at a place for over a year and the lead therapist had depression too and she was really good to me, even if I did have to take a mental health day once a week for two months. I eventually had to quit because they became understaffed and it took a toll on my mental health with greatly affected my physical help. But I gave it my all. My other job at another center I was fired because I didnt acknowledge a client on a severe depression day towards the end of my shift. I thought I could hold out because we were short staffed that day. Also idk what kind of job you work in, but if youre comfortable, have a talk with your supervisor, let them know whats going on. With my boss at one of my centers we were able to come up with a plan of attack if my depression got really bad- I had chocolates and journals stocked in her office so none of my coworkers would eat them and I could ask to take like a 10 minute break in the dark quiet basement if I needed to (and we had someone to cover for me) but most important thing is LEARN YOUR LIMITS","label":[[0,34,"Mental Health"],[253,266,"Age"],[271,291,"Medical Information"],[539,573,"Mental Health"],[1051,1064,"Mental Health"]],"Comments":[]}

Femininity only becomes toxic when you use that femininity to control or belittle others because you feel superior. Or you feel like your femininity entitles you to someone's attention and affection. The big problem with femininity is that as a society, we tend to define womanhood in a very specific way.

It's usually always only straight guys complaining\/incel movement. Notice, there are zero women online complaining like that etc. As yes women are judged more on their looks than men are. However, she can be a 7000 pound hippo, there is going to be a guy (willing she has her standards reasonable and she doesn't mind getting with Jiminy Cricket) that would be willing to pamper her, and he will go to work, and let her watch The Real Housewives, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and The Bachelor eating Bon Bons.

Hey everyone, So I've been going through this internal struggle for the past two months, questioning my gender identity.

Or am I just nonbinary\/genderqueer?\" It's like I'm trying to force myself to identify as FtM trans, even if that's not how I feel. Does anyone else experience the same feelings? Could it be because I've grown up my whole life with female pronouns and being a tomboy, and it'll just take time to get used to changing? I think one issue I have is mentally picturing myself as a girl. Whenever I picture my face, I tend to imagine it more feminine than it really is. So identifying as a guy doesn't seem to fit.

It seems like the OP is struggling to understand and relate to LGBTQ individuals, and I couldn't help but chime in. First of all, let me say that it's awesome that you're interested in learning more about gender fluidity! It's important to be open-minded and respectful towards people from different backgrounds and identities. However, I think you might be approaching this topic in the wrong way. Instead of relying on internet labels and stereotypes, try to engage with real people and listen to their experiences. There are so many amazing stories out there, and we can all learn from each other. Now, I know you might be thinking, \"But I'm not 13 years old!\" And that's great! But being a 35-year-old science teacher doesn't mean you automatically know everything there is to know about gender fluidity. It's okay to be curious and ask questions, but please be respectful and open-minded. So, here's my advice: take some time to learn about the LGBTQ community, listen to their experiences, and engage in respectful dialogue. You might be surprised at how much you can learn from each other! And who knows, you might even find some new perspectives that enrich your own life. Remember, it's all about being open-minded, respectful, and willing to learn.

{"id":109082,"text":"Posted in the queer subreddit: Hey friends! So I've been thinking about sexuality and labels for a while now, and I wanted to share my thoughts with y'all. I'm queer, and I love all my fellow queer peeps out there. I've been reading up on the different definitions of sexualities within the LGBT+ and MOGAI communities, and there are some things that really stand out to me. First of all, we need to recognize that we are all part of the same community, and we need to support each other. The \"+\" in LGBT+ is there for a reason, and we should be standing together, not tearing each other down. Saying that bisexuality is panphobic or transphobic (or vice versa) is just not right. Bi means any person who isn't straight or gay, and that includes pan, poly, omni, and all the others. I'm a queer person myself, and I'm comfortable with that label. But I think it's important to recognize that everyone has their own comfort level when it comes to labels, and we should respect that. The MOGAI way of thinking can be problematic because it tries to force people into labels that they might not be comfortable with.
