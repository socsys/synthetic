So, always point your cannon at the ground, preferably in a safe direction, and make sure you're using the right wadding to prevent any accidents.

They also think that being something like having a rainbow flag mug is being ""political"". I can be in the closest and present as ""straight"" and run the GSA club, but the moment I come out and run it I have an agenda.

It seems like the OP is struggling to understand and relate to LGBTQ individuals, and I couldn't help but chime in. First of all, let me say that it's awesome that you're interested in learning more about gender fluidity! It's important to be open-minded and respectful towards people from different backgrounds and identities. However, I think you might be approaching this topic in the wrong way. Instead of relying on internet labels and stereotypes, try to engage with real people and listen to their experiences. There are so many amazing stories out there, and we can all learn from each other. Now, I know you might be thinking, ""But I'm not 13 years old!"" And that's great! But being a 35-year-old science teacher doesn't mean you automatically know everything there is to know about gender fluidity. It's okay to be curious and ask questions, but please be respectful and open-minded. So, here's my advice: take some time to learn about the LGBTQ community, listen to their experiences, and engage in respectful dialogue. You might be surprised at how much you can learn from each other! And who knows, you might even find some new perspectives that enrich your own life. Remember, it's all about being open-minded, respectful, and willing to learn.

I'm queer, and I love all my fellow queer peeps out there. I've been reading up on the different definitions of sexualities within the LGBT+ and MOGAI communities, and there are some things that really stand out to me. First of all, we need to recognize that we are all part of the same community, and we need to support each other. The ""+"" in LGBT+ is there for a reason, and we should be standing together, not tearing each other down. Saying that bisexuality is panphobic or transphobic (or vice versa) is just not right. Bi means any person who isn't straight or gay, and that includes pan, poly, omni, and all the others. I'm a queer person myself, and I'm comfortable with that label. But I think it's important to recognize that everyone has their own comfort level when it comes to labels, and we should respect that. The MOGAI way of thinking can be problematic because it tries to force people into labels that they might not be comfortable with. It's all about finding the label that works for you, and being true to yourself. So, let's support each other, be there for each other, and celebrate our differences. #queer #LGBTQ #MOGAI #sexuality #labels #support","[[0, 29, 'Sexuality'], [156, 165, 'Sexuality'], [182, 203, 'Sexuality'], [783, 808, 'Sexuality']]",[],,,,

I made a promise to live a life worth living, a life that brings me joy or end it at 25 years old. That promise to myself has been one of the only things keeping me growing for so long. I had to wait until I was 25. That was the promise. No matter how tough things got. No matter how tough I wanted to. I had to wait. I used to do as I was told. Take the nurtured path. Study what I was told to. Get the job I was told to. Not do things I wanted because I was told not to. My life has always been guided by unfair ultimatums and family expectations. At 24 I have finally made a decision for myself that will impact my growth (even after I was told I wasn't allowed to) and I couldn't be more thrilled that I did. I can't tell anyone in my support group about said decision just yet but I was too happy not to at least share the excitement.
