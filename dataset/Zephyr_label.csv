It's commonly associated with an increased chance of impulsivity and hyperactivity. Many of us also have a sensory processing disorder. The most common physical issue associated with ADHD is ADHD-PI, which is also known as ADD. Doctors aren't entirely sure why ADHD happens. There's no cure, just ways to manage around it. Note: ADHD is not a behavioral disorder. ADHD behavior is completely logical in accordance with our ways of processing. If you processed the way we did, you would behave the way we did. Please avoid any form of behavioral therapy (behavioral therapy apologists, leave me alone). ADHD children grow up to become ADHD adults. So, this depends on what you define as normal.

Here's my story: I've been a closeted bisexual for years, but I finally mustered the courage to come out to my partner. It was a tough conversation, but we're still together and our relationship is stronger than ever. We're currently in a long-distance relationship, which can be tough, but we're making it work. I stumbled upon this dating app called ""Cupid's Arrow"" and decided to give it a try. At first, I was skeptical, but I've met some amazing people through the app. It's helped me connect with others who share similar interests and values, and I've even made some new friends. One person, in particular, caught my eye. We hit it off right away and have been talking nonstop ever since. We've been video chatting every day and it feels like we've known each other forever. I'm excited to see where this relationship goes, but I'm also nervous because we're still in the early stages. Any","['Relationship', 'Sexuality']"
