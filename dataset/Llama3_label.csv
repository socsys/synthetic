I felt pressured to commit, so I agreed. Now, I'm facing the daunting prospect of hiking in the Swiss Alps alone, without any familiar faces or backup. I'm getting anxious just thinking about it – the thought of navigating unfamiliar terrain, sleeping in a shared cabin with strangers, and being cut off from my phone for an extended period is giving me the heebie-jeebies.

My Latinx friend is also a polyglot and for them, they don't mind my other friend using certain linguistic patterns AS LONG AS they don't have to use them (which works out because this friend has multiple languages besides the one in question) but that's one Latinx person among many.

They'll need to assess you and then refer you to a gender clinic. From there, it's a waiting game until you can get an appointment. But don't worry, it's worth it! The clinic will work with you to develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your needs. And, if you're lucky, you might even get to skip the waiting list if you have a therapist who is already familiar with the clinic.
