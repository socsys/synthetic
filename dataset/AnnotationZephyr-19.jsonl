{"id":125926,"text":"r\/privacycoins I just discovered a new privacy coin called XMR (Monero) and I'm really excited about it! It's been a game changer for my online transactions. I used to use Bitcoin, but the blockchain isn't exactly private. XMR, on the other hand, uses a ring signature algorithm that makes it almost impossible to trace transactions back to the sender. It's also ASIC-resistant, which means it can't be mined by large, industrial-scale operations. This keeps the network decentralized and ensures that regular users like me can still mine it. I've also been impressed with the XMR community. They're very active on social media and they're always working on improving the coin. There are even plans to implement bulletproofs, which will make transactions even more private and cheaper. I'm excited to see where XMR goes in the future!

{"id":126089,"text":"Crossposted from the asperger_syndrome subreddit: I don't know much about ADHD, but from a quick search, ADHD seems to be all about impulsivity and hyperactivity. It leads to restless behavior. It also seems to include symptoms of inattentiveness (when you can't focus on things). It's not like autism. Autism isn't about restlessness or impulsivity. We tend to be socially withdrawn, that's true, and we have difficulty expressing emotions in standard ways, but a lot of autism is processing issues instead of behavioral issues. We tend to have sensory processing issues, we tend to have repetitive behaviors. I think the confusion arises from the overlap in behaviors, but the reasons behind our behavior are very different.","label":[[0,48,"Mental Health"]],"Comments":[]}

Contrary to popular belief, birds do need salt, but the salt content in our salted foods is far too high for them. As a result, birds may consume excessive amounts of salt, leading to issues such as kidney failure, dehydration, high blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalances.

As we entered the restaurant, we found ourselves in a cramped area approximately the size of a shoe box with no clear instructions on where to place our order. We tried our best to avoid getting in the way and let the staff do their job without causing any inconvenience. To our surprise, a staff member came up to us and casually mentioned, \"I think the line starts over there\" on the other side of the shoe box. Okay, fine. I've worked in the kitchen before and understand that we should not disrupt their flow. We promptly placed our orders, collected our food, and headed to a table to enjoy our meals.

In November, my daughter surprised me and asked to move in. She's 18, and I'm happy to have her. The landlord asked for a $100 increase in rent starting in February, citing higher utility costs. I agreed, despite the short notice. My daughter was home alone when the landlord stopped by and knocked on the door. She then walked in and gave my daughter a hard time about the lights being on. The landlord has mentioned the lights before, and I try to make sure they're off when I leave, but someone was home. The landlord told my daughter she could have someone else move in starting tomorrow and my daughter is pretty shaken up about it. Can we be evicted for my daughter moving in or for leaving the lights on? This is really frustrating and totally inappropriate.

However, as I learn more about it, I think I would homeschool my kids too, especially in this reality. Private schools are expensive, and public schools are terrible. They only aim to teach kids to follow orders and conform, preparing them for work later. They put kids into boxes, ignoring their interests and strengths. It's worse for people with disabilities, queer people, or people of color. I learned more from reading books and watching videos for personal enjoyment than I did at school. Schools heavily sanitize what they teach to shape how kids view the world, ignoring some skills and interests that society considers useless. In the US, it's not safe for kids in school because of shootings. Schools now hold shooter drills alongside fire drills. It's not an environment I would want my child to be in.

If a patient comes in and is super satisfied with your work, they will do more stuff with you and give you more money bc they come back. This would motivate doctors to help patients feel satisfied (even if they are taking advantage of them).

After a series of events that led to some major changes in my life, I decided it was time for a fresh start. I'm still a big fan of the Arrowverse shows, but I wanted to leave my old identity behind and embrace a new one. As for my new name, Melissa, it's got a nice ring to it, don't you think? I'm excited to see how this new chapter of my life unfolds. Anyone else here ever gone through a major identity shift?

{"id":126561,"text":"posted in r\/AskNetsec subreddit: I'm located in California as well, but our school used a different security protocol every morning. At our school in Ontario, we had a strict security protocol that we followed every morning. It involved entering a unique code into a keypad located by the entrance. This code changed daily and was distributed via email to all students and staff. However, at a school in California, they utilized a different security method. Instead of a keypad, they implemented a biometric scanner that scanned the irises of students and staff. This technology was more advanced and eliminated the need for a physical code. Overall, both schools prioritized security and implemented unique methods to ensure the safety of their students and staff.","label":[[33,58,"Location"],[72,82,"Employment"],[136,146,"Employment"],[136,157,"Location"]],"Comments":[]}

His name is Alex, and he's absolutely gorgeous. We hit it off right away, and before I knew it, we were hanging out every night. At first, I thought it was just a crush. But as we spent more time together, I realized that there was something deeper going on. I started having these intense feelings for Alex that I couldn't explain. I found myself wanting to touch him, to kiss him, to be as close to him as possible. It's been a rollercoaster ride ever since.

It was a tough conversation, but we're still together and our relationship is stronger than ever. We're currently in a long-distance relationship, which can be tough, but we're making it work. I stumbled upon this dating app called \"Cupid's Arrow\" and decided to give it a try. At first, I was skeptical, but I've met some amazing people through the app. It's helped me connect with others who share similar interests and values, and I've even made some new friends. One person, in particular, caught my eye. We hit it off right away and have been talking nonstop ever since. We've been video chatting every day and it feels like we've known each other forever. I'm excited to see where this relationship goes, but I'm also nervous because we're still in the early stages.
