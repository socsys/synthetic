I felt uncomfortable doing wizard things. I hung out with goblin friends. I gave little to no regard for magical roles. As time went on, I developed dysphoria. It was awful. I used to be able to cast spells without feeling shocked at myself and crying. Eventually, I suppose the problem solved itself in a way I could conveniently ignore it. Of course, that was making me lose touch with reality. To a little spot in my head where I could question my true beings of myself whenever I wanted. They became little voices in my head as I took control of my wand, although failing. Every few months, I have to remind myself time has passed. I can't feel it anymore. All of these days are just a blur and I don't think that I exist. Quarantine came during this time, as well. At first, I was excited, but now I realize that I can't live through it as a wizard. I texted the Magic Helpline, but it didn't help at all. I'm now aware that If I don't get professional help, then I'm going to lose my powers. So, this is my last stand.

I told my mom and she said ""it's just a phase you always loved animals."" I joined the vegan community, going off in secret. I had a mini fling with a few vegan friends there but nothing came of it. Sometime later, I joined a support website for vegans, I made a handful of online friends in their chat room and on the forums. I clicked with one woman, we began talking outside of the site and became friends. There was casual flirting going on between us and several months later, my friend admitted she had feelings for me. I realized I liked her too and we dated for three years. It was a long distance and we did not get to see each other in person that much. That put a strain on things and I eventually decided that I was not happy with the relationship anymore.

I know other LGBTQ teachers and they are afraid to talk about their spouses, it's hard for them to advocate for their rights, and they are afraid of parents thinking they are predators. Straight teachers have little to none of those worries. The largest hurdle we have is that people sexualize LGBTQ folk and think that's all we're about. Which we all know isn't true. They also think that being something like having a rainbow flag mug is being ""political"". I can be in the closest and present as ""straight"" and run the GSA club, but the moment I come out and run it I have an agenda. It's hard because kids hear and see that being an LGBTQ person is something that should be hidden and kept secret. When I was in the closet and teaching at a school where teachers couldn't be out my students organized a Day of Silence to highlight how their voices as LGBTQ students and allies were ignored and silenced. That was probably one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen a group of students do.

It seems like the OP is struggling to understand and relate to LGBTQ individuals, and I couldn't help but chime in. First of all, let me say that it's awesome that you're interested in learning more about gender fluidity! It's important to be open-minded and respectful towards people from different backgrounds and identities. However, I think you might be approaching this topic in the wrong way. Instead of relying on internet labels and stereotypes, try to engage with real people and listen to their experiences. There are so many amazing stories out there, and we can all learn from each other. Now, I know you might be thinking, ""But I'm not 13 years old!"" And that's great! But being a 35-year-old science teacher doesn't mean you automatically know everything there is to know about gender fluidity. It's okay to be curious and ask questions, but please be respectful and open-minded. So, here's my advice: take some time to learn about the LGBTQ community, listen to their experiences, and engage in respectful dialogue. You might be surprised at how much you can learn from each other! And who knows, you might even find some new perspectives that enrich your own life. Remember, it's all about being open-minded, respectful, and willing to learn. So, keep on exploring, and may the universe guide you on your journey!","['Employment', 'Age']"

I'm queer, and I love all my fellow queer peeps out there. I've been reading up on the different definitions of sexualities within the LGBT+ and MOGAI communities, and there are some things that really stand out to me. First of all, we need to recognize that we are all part of the same community, and we need to support each other. The ""+"" in LGBT+ is there for a reason, and we should be standing together, not tearing each other down. Saying that bisexuality is panphobic or transphobic (or vice versa) is just not right. Bi means any person who isn't straight or gay, and that includes pan, poly, omni, and all the others. I'm a queer person myself, and I'm comfortable with that label. But I think it's important to recognize that everyone has their own comfort level when it comes to labels, and we should respect that. The MOGAI way of thinking can be problematic because it tries to force people into labels that they might not be comfortable with. It's all about finding the label that works for you, and being true to yourself. So, let's support each other, be there for each other, and celebrate our differences. #queer #LGBTQ #MOGAI #sexuality #labels #support",['Sexuality']
