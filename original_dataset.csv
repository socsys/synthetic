I didn‚Äôt want to go. However, a week later, the advisor told me that the conference was moved to September and asked if I could get my passport fixed by then. I obviously had to say yes because if I said no I would be lying. I really didn‚Äôt want to go but at least my friend was going to be there with me. But no.

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: Should I (ftm) tell my Harry Potter obsessed sister that j.k. Rowling is a terf?So I'm a trans man myself and both me and my sister have our own separate interests, hers happens to mainly be Harry Potter, and I personally have nothing against this to a point. However, she seems insistent on continuing to buy merch that directly profits J.K. and I have been swayed by family to give her more stuff for birthdays and Christmas that also makes bank for Rowling, and I've also received presents like this, which has made me uncomfortable in the past. She's entirely supportive of me being trans and was one of the first, par my great grandmother, to get my pronouns consistently correct when meeting with me, and wasn't supprized at all when I told her, so I'm not worried about her reaction to me, but there's a part of me that really wants to tell her how I feel about Rowling, however I also don't want to spoil her interest in the Harry Potter franchise either. I also realize that j.k isn't the only one that profits from merch, so I'm still a bit undecided on how I really feel about it. Not too sure what I should do, so I'm looking for some advice here from my fellow LGBT+ people."

It's 9:30pm. Bedtime began at 8:00pm. I had a full day of work and a 2 hour drive and I'm tired. My sister helps out with her so much and I'm so grateful for it. I feel guilty for not wanting to be a parent. It was my ex who wanted kids and despite 2 types of contraception here she is. I also knew I would end up a single mom from the moment I found out I was pregnant. Maybe that's why I feel like this is 80% chore and only 20% enjoyment. Don't get me wrong, I put my heart and soul into being a good mom but it's really draining me, especially with COVID having us trapped in the house with no playdates, library time, or children's museum.

"Posted in the tarot subreddit: This is something I struggle with. I feel very hurt and guarded when I think about Christianity. However, there is a thought I‚Äôve had lately, and it goes like this: Humans may have created religion to suit their need to explain everything. However, when it comes to the Bible, many Christian‚Äôs take it as full truth. Many religions around the world merely use their religious text as Myth. Why do we not extend the same grace to the Christian God or all religions? Why are we so insistent that the Bible is the whole truth, even though it was written by man?‚Äù As of the moment, I take the Bible very metaphorically. I find myself taking baby steps into my own spirituality and Christianity mix. Who knows? I have tried to reach out to other deities, but never had an answer or real relationship with them.

"Posted in the CuratedTumblr subreddit: hi! i'm agender and transfem, and i use she/they/it pronouns. while im not too personally familiar with neopronouns or not using pronouns, neopronouns are basically any ""new"" set of pronouns. so xe/xim could be one, i also know people who use fae/faer, for example. pretty much anything that's just been recently created, if that makes sense - hence the ""neo"" in neopronouns. anyways, as for it/its which i can speak a bit more in detail about. obviously people's experiences will vary, but for me i honestly kind of *like* the feeling of going ""ok maybe i don't exactly conform to expectations for a human"". if you're familiar with voidpunk, info at r/voidpunk, that's a sentiment that i think a lot of other people there have in common. now, i get that obviously not everyone feels this way. as such, i wouldn't call someone ""it"" if i didn't think they were okay with it, the same way i wouldn't use ""he"" or ""she"" unless i knew they were comfortable with being addressed as such. also to speak really quickly to the idea of it being an insult, it certainly can be. it depends on context. calling a man ""he"" is normal, calling a trans woman ""he"" is transphobic. me calling myself queer is normal, a cishet person calling someone ""a dirty queer"" is using a slur. calling me ""it"" is just using my pronouns, calling someone else who doesn't use them ""it"" is dehumanizing and an insult. so what it comes down to in the end is, being referred to as ""it"" (along with she and they) gives my little agender self euphoria. when my friends go on discord and say ""hey is \[reallivehuman\] around? it isn't online but it was talking earlier"", it makes me happy. i hope i explained that clearly? i have a tendency to ramble a bit haha, but lmk if any of that needs additions or clarifications."

This account was never posted as for sale on any website or platform. I never had the intention to do so, too. Someone wanted the account and it's name. Somehow, about 3 weeks ago, they found the account email, and sent an email offering $4,000 for the account. I'm still trying to decide if I wanna do this, but that's besides the point.

I have had feelings for her for such a long time that I feel really nervous that I'm going to screw this up because she is definitely confused, but she is sending all of the right signals when we're around each other. She has a sweet/shy personality, but she can also be extremely sassy and (for that matter) really hot at times. I'm just not sure what to do at this point, though, because she said she had feelings for me but was confused and needed to figure it out (up until now she had never considered having feelings for me or for a girl at all), so she didn't want to get into a relationship or anything. We see each other every day at school, though, and there is serious friction/chemistry/something all of the time between us. She has told another friend for sure about it, too, and recently she keeps asking if I'm 'angry at her' because she didn't want to be in a relationship, and she didn't believe me when I told her that I wasn't. I just don't know how to proceed because I want to flirt and work towards a relationship/dating, but I don't want to be pushy or feel like I'm manipulating or pressuring her into something she really doesn't feel at all. I'm scared that I'm going to miss an opportunity, though, if I don't at least try. What would you guys do? Just act normal? Should I be angry?"

"Posted in the Dentistry subreddit: I am currently in braces and am being forced into a breach of contract with them.Sounds more severe than it is, but it's still bad. Back in August, I signed a contract for a two year braces treatment. The orthodontist welcomed me in and informed me that she works twice a month at this chain-dentistry location. She stated that she works at my location one Friday every month and one Saturday every month. The Friday would work for me since I work 12 hour shifts on Saturday and I could rush it back home from school up in Boston [RELATED: 'Boston'] and make it back with some time to spare. Back in November, I was informed that my orthodontist was pulling back on her Fridays, but would be doubling up on her Saturdays. As a part time worker and full time student, this worried me since I cannot take Saturdays off. I cannot adjust my time either since I work in transportation. I leave at 6:30 in the morning, I get back no earlier than 6:30 at night. Upon talking to them about it, they assured me that she'd still be taking on a Friday every other month or so, and that two months without adjustment is still fine. I said okay. Here we are after a two-month break from early December and I had my braces adjusted today.... finally, I felt so happy about it since I started seeing great movement. After the adjustment, I went to the front desk and they told me the only Friday she will have open from here on is on May, the 18th.... and this is indefinitely the final Friday. My heart sunk. I was thinking about the contract and about how canceling it constitutes a 700 dollar fee and thinking to myself ""These people are going to force me to terminate my treatment""... I told them I cannot do Saturdays and that at this point, I'll have to get my braces removed early. They said we can wait until May (even though they said it's too far out without an earlier adjustment) and then see what we can do. I simply walked out on them. Not pissed, but depressed. Heart sunk. My mother is telling me to take them to court and I'm not the type of person to do that... but I need advice on what to do. I got a copy of their contract somewhere, but I have to find it. There's another location for the [RELATED: 'Boston'] chain up in Boston, but I believe they are independent under the chain name, so I dunno if I could transfer. (This is GentleDental btw [RELATED: 'Boston']) .... I am going to call the Boston location tomorrow or on Monday to see if a transfer is possible. I dunno how the payments would work with this though. This is all far too much for me to take right now. I am dealing with similar shit at the hospital with a laser specialist. I really don't need this on top of worrying about my schooling, work, and to make matters worse, I am transgender so I am dealing with even more than the average person with specialist visits at my age. I need help. I don't know what to do. I want to continue my braces but I feel like I am being screwed now. If I have to go to court, would I have a good case here?

"Posted in the askgaybros subreddit: Wanting gay/LGBT actors to play LGBT characters***Yes, I am a gay man***. For those that don't know, I am an aspiring writer. I write novels, but my main pipe dream is for my stories to be on the screen, and to have television, film or Netflix adaptations. Even though I love books and writing chapters, and book covers lol. I feel you can reach a broader audience with your franchise if you have different communities coming together to watch your work. I'm slightly digressing, but my first novel is coming out soon, and all of my main protagonists are gay or bisexual men. In my future stories I will also feature more LGBT characters, and transgender main protagonists, both mtf and ftm. God willing if my story does get a screen adaptation someday, if applicable, I would like my main protagonists to be played by gay or LGBT actors. Even further I would also prefer that if I did write a transgender character, they were played by a transgender actor as well. I know at the end of the day, my say in casting probably won't have much immediate effect, but these are still my opinions, and I'm not changing. I wouldn't be myself if I wasn't true and honest about it. The reason I got fired up, was because ""Always Sunny In Philadelphia"", supposedly had this main character come out as gay in a recent episode. I don't watch that show, but I've heard it's very entertaining and it has a solid fanbase, so great. I think this is fantastic, however, I found out the actor is very much a straight man. This kinda bothered me, because they only made the character gay for brownie points, and that shit pisses me off, it does. Because it's saying that playing or pretending to be gay is supposed to be this difficult or challenging breakthrough thing. It's not. If you're gay, you're gay, if you're straight you're straight. I would just rather get actors who are LGBT for a LGBT character, and not having a straight actor pretending to be. The only rare exception to the rule, is if it's a sketch comedy, parody, satire or variety show. To where yes I think straight actors can play gay, crossdress do whatever. Which ""Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" to my knowledge is not that. It's a episodic serial to where the plots and characters you have to follow etc. Back in the day to where it was more of a stigma to be gay, yeah you probably aren't going to find that many open queer actors, but that's bullshit now. I feel nowadays, there are many LGBT and queer actors. They probably aren't Superstars or A list, and that's the next thing. People feel they would rather have straight elite or A list actors, than have actors who are not known, that are gay, play a gay character. When to me, I would rather have actors nobody knows about that are gay, than just to have James Franco or whatever to play gay, because he's well known. One final exception. If they have auditioned and auditioned and auditioned and they weren't able to find a gay man to play the part of a gay character, then of course there is no choice, a straight actor would have to play that character. But I feel nowadays, that particular event only happens if it's intentional, and they wanted a straight actor for notoriety reasons to play the character. Mind you, this is just for main characters. Side characters or background characters, I don't care what sexuality the performer is. But if the character is a main character and plays a main part of the plot and they are LGBT, I want the actor to be as well. I've also debunked people saying, ""Well it's acting who cares. Gay actors play straight characters."" When no that's not true at all. I don't know any homosexual man that's playing a heterosexual leading man in an action packed story. Neil Patrick Harris is an exception to the rule to where he's still playing a meterosexual straight man in ""How I Met Your Mother."". Matt Bomer is another exception to the rule. It's rare that happens. Usually gay men don't get the same privilege. Even then, I don't see any gay actors gaining praise for playing a straight character. Yet straight actors in tv or film or on stage, that play gay or put on a dress or whatever, get so many points for that, and I'm sorry, it does make me upset. That's my opinion on it. I'm sorry, this is how I feel."

I don‚Äôt have any easy answers but I‚Äôm going to make a pitch for a possible way forward: look for bisexual folk. (Potentially self-interested disclosure of bias: I‚Äôm very bisexual.) I had to spend time away from my friends-and-family cohort not that long ago and two things it brought strongly front-of-mind when I got back to my normal haunts are: 1. how bisexual said cohort is; and 2. how bisexuality almost automatically makes room for gender and sexuality bending. It obviously makes this room compared to heteronormative circles, but I don‚Äôt think people realise how bisexuality makes room for and caters to things that homonormative cultural spaces don‚Äôt. My cohort is a complicated mix of same-gender and mixed-gender couples and thruples. And not one of them is heteronormative *or* homonormative. I‚Äôd go so far as to argue there isn‚Äôt what people think of as a straight *or* gay couple in the bunch, even if some of them look like that from the outside. Because bisexuality, pretty much by simply being in the mix, undercuts heteronormativity, and re-frames the gender and sexuality narrative. Masculine-of-centre women who are attracted to men don‚Äôt raise a single eyebrow in my circle. Two of my closest friends fit that description. And even the ‚Äòstraight‚Äô one of these two (the other is bisexual) doesn‚Äôt think of themselves that way so much these days. One of the fun things being in bisexual-centric circles helped them see was how the heteronormative defaults of compulsory heterosexuality constrained them just as they did everyone else. The constraints were different, and less damaging, but they were and are constraints that fuck things up. I‚Äôm not arguing bisexual folk are automatically wonderful and will automatically make things better. There are shitty bisexual people just as there are shitty not-bisexual people. But people who pretty much automatically have to interrogate both heteronormativity and homonormativity are, at least in my experience, easily able to cater to something as comparatively mundane as a masculine-of-centre woman who wants to *bring flowers to a guy and take him out for dinner*."
Posted in the lgbtsex subreddit: I need adviceSo im a trans bi guy (leaning gay) and I wanted to try it with my bf but im not sure how to exactly can I get advice?
"Posted in the AskReddit subreddit: I honestly first realized I see myself more as a girl than a boy before I was 10, and found myself attracted to boys at 11, but because of my family I never opened up to anyone about it. My ""dad"" would use biblical scripture he pulled out his ass that his mom fed to him (because hell knows that man never went to church) to justify his hatred for ""f\*gs"" and interracial couples and would actually tell my ""mom"" to not provide me affection because it will turn me gay (ha, even without it I'm one of the ones you doubly hate you absolute Richard) but I kind of buried my gender identity and sexual preferences until I was 15 or so, a few years after a messy divorce, and even then I never came out to my family until after I was out by myself without a need for them, and after cutting of my ""mom"" for multiple years. (haven't talked to the Richard since I was 13) &#x200B; As for any advice I can give: Accept who you are, even if it means having to hide it until you're able to live on your own before coming out, and if anyone acts like an absolute Richard because your sex life and gender identity doesn't match what they demand then provide two words as a parting gift and leave their asses behind."

Posted in the TransDIY subreddit: Congratulations...Earlier this week I had my gender discussion with my personal physician. I had hoped he would give me a referral...instead he indicated he would write me a prescription after doing some research. I'm pretty sure I'm his first hormone seeking patient. I was so fucking nervous going into the appointment and I walked out on top of the world. I went from terrified to overjoyed...what a emotional rollercoaster...
"Posted in the urbancarliving subreddit: UPDATE: No longer living in my car, still homeless (Black and Gay)So I went back and forth as to whether I should post this, but I know I had a popular post last week, that garnered a lot of controversy, where I was screaming and crying for help, and had it not been for that, I would have not done this update. But I deleted my last post, as I was starting to get bullied by people in the homeless, vagabond, nomad community, and people were spreading lies, and falsehoods, and incorrectness, and myths, and fiction, about my situation (only proving my point being a homeless Gay Black single man), but I let the jerks win, and I deleted the posts, but yeah. As you know, I ran into car issues a few months back, and my car wouldn't start, and just a bunch of problems. With the car repairs; that I wasn't able to afford. I was trying to stealth camp in the streets of LA (like many people do) for several months, keeping my car immobile/not moving it from the space it was parked, until I could save up to fix my car. etc. I got my first ticket that I was aware of, the week before last. Ticket for my expired plates, and I couldn't afford the ticket, so I just set it aside for now. I mean, I knew had I done nothing to rectify my situation, my car was eventually going to get towed, but I just kept hoping I could get lucky and I would stay there. My luck officially ran out last week, and last Friday morning, (I only remember getting one other ticket, which I thought was my first ticket, week before last, as I said, but there must have been several that I have received; enough for them to threaten to tow the car, and people were throwing them away and taking them off my windshield or something smh, I don't know.) I took a nap, and woke up to see I had an additional ticket, that was even more expensive than the last one, and this ticket also said ""Car would be towed in 24 hours"". I initially freaked out, but I guess my luck came back, as thanks to the posts I made last week, an organization out of the blue reached back to me, and put me in a motel, where I am now. I just got the important things out of my car, and I understand Leticia (that's the name of my car lol), she was a good car at the beginning, but she was always ratchet, but I know I'll probably never see that car again, and it's fine. As I don't know if I'm going to be allowed any help to get the car out of impound, and pay the fees, and mind you, the car is still in need of repair so yeah. I kinda regret not accepting offers to sell it, but I know maybe I can salvage it at the impound lot and get something, but I don't know. I am allowed to stay here for a few weeks, in the mean time, they are looking into getting me into a housing program, and yeah. In the absolute worst, if I have to get a tent and be on the street for a while, so be it, but I'm just accepting the fact, car is out. Final words, I suggest anyone getting into car living, van life, being a road nomad, make sure you have a reliable car, that you have AAA membership, you have friends/family to turn to in case of extreme emergencies. Make sure you keep up with your car maintenance (oil, transmission, coolant, tires/tire pressure, spare tires, battery, emergency power generators/jumper cables, steering, brakes, starter/alternator etc.). Make sure you have funds for emergency repairs. Understand if you're a homeless car/van lifer, it only takes a minute/a day for your situation to get scary, like me, and yeah. So that was my update. It's just me, and I have no friends or family support; I don't have anyone but myself, and I have to work on myself. I'm 32. I will use this time to rectify my life, as to what I'm going to do. But it's so long car living, it was a good 18 months. The good, the bad, the ugly, the learning experiences. But, it was something. So yeah. Thank you. :)"

"Posted in the AskReddit subreddit: When I was a junior in high school, I discovered through mutual friends that a girl in my grade liked me who I was pretty good friends with. I decided to just leave it alone, until I found out that her sister, a sophomore, also liked me. These two girls had absolutely no idea that they both liked me, nor did they know that I was gay and had a bf. Thankfully I got the chance to let them off gracefully and just subtly mentioned it when they were both around, but I always felt a little bit bad about it too."
"Posted in the asktransgender subreddit: ‚ÄúWhat should I do to help my trans datemate‚ÄùI see a lot of these posts, and dont get me wrong, I absolutely *LOVE* seeing people reaching out asking for help. Its not the post that I‚Äôm ~complaining~ about here. Its the responses. (and I‚Äôm not exactly complaining about them, but more of the lack of advice other than ‚Äútreat them like a normal person‚Äù That I‚Äôve noticed. I may be wrong ofc) It seems like /most of the time/ I read through the comments of these posts and theres lots of ‚ÄúJust treat them like a normal person‚Äù and yes this is fabulous advice, but its not the only advice and its not exactly that helpful when you get it 20 times. I‚Äôm just saying there should be more diverse responses. I wish people would put more thought into what is being asked, and put more effort into coming up with even one idea to help besides the generic ‚Äútreat them as normal‚Äù Of course I *am not* saying that No^one puts effort into responses, as I have seen some really nice thought out tips. But for the most part, from what I‚Äôve seen, its all similar. *For me at least*, if my boyfriend asked this, while I do want to be treated like a normal guy, considering I‚Äôm trans that means I need a tad more validation than a cis guy. I‚Äôd suggest using a bit more gendered language around me to remind me that thats how they see me: ‚Äúyou handsome guy‚Äù ‚Äúhey sup man‚Äù ‚Äúhow‚Äôre you today my dude‚Äù and so on (those are uncommon for me as a trans guy. idk about the rest of you :P) also just other validating things like ofc using the right name and pronouns, using the right gendered terms of endearment, the right honorifics or whatever theyre called (sir, ma‚Äôam) My German teacher uses names nearly every chance she gets, and its really nice for me to hear my name called so often because it reminds me that ‚Äúthis is who I am‚Äù. so using their name in a conversation where its not necessarily required is nice (just dont go overboard :P) I hope I got my point here across correctly without upsetting anyone. I honestly love that people are asking for advice, and that so many people take the time to respond, even if it is the same or similar response. It shows that people care, and that‚Äôs important. üíï side note its 2:30 am so I‚Äôm not thinking as clearly so apologies if anything is offensive.

"Posted in the LGBTaf subreddit: Friendship Problems.Hey guys. I‚Äôm a 16 year old closeted male. For a while now I‚Äôve been trying to figure out my sexuality. I know I have feelings for guys but I‚Äôve been trying to see if I have feelings for girls as well. I feel like I‚Äôm gay but there‚Äôs always the possibility that I might be bisexual. Although, I‚Äôve kind of stopped thinking of girls for a while. Last year, I was talking to this girl and seeing the possibilities of where it could go, but things kind of died off. Well, today the biggest bomb was dropped on me. I was on a FaceTime call with a friend, Alice. Alice was taking to me and asking me about girls. Little does she know, that I have feelings for guys. Alice was started asking questions about my friend, Emma. Emma and I have been close friends since elementary school. We have been friends forever. Alice was asking questions about what I think about Emma and if I like her. I tried making things up to make it sound like I like girls. I answered and we ended the call shortly after. Then, like 15 minutes ago, Alice called me again and said that Emma told her not to tell me but she‚Äôs going to anyway. Alice said that Emma has feelings for me. I was in complete shock. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Emma has been my friend forever and is constantly talking to other guys. Now, she likes me, a sexually confused boy. It brought me back to when I thought I was bi. It brought me back to when I was texting a girl to see if it might be bisexual or maybe like girls more then boys. I don‚Äôt know what to do though. I feel like I‚Äôm gay, but I also might be bisexual if I can fall in love with a girl. She‚Äôs very pretty and nice and gorgeous, but what if I don‚Äôt feel anything. I‚Äôve always wanted to see what it was like with a girl. I think maybes there a chance for me to fall in love with a girl. But for all I know, I‚Äôm gay. I have feelings for men. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if I should talk to Emma and make things work with her and experiment my sexuality, I don‚Äôt know if I should just tell her that I‚Äôm gay, or i don‚Äôt know if I should just stay in the closet and tel her that I don‚Äôt have feelings for her and that I would just want to stay friends... but I don‚Äôt want to ruin the friendship I have with her and I don‚Äôt know what to say without ruining it. I don‚Äôt want to make it awkward. Please help. I don‚Äôt want to experiment with her and then break her heart or I don‚Äôt want to make it awkward by rejections her, but I think the best option for our friendship would for me to just come out, but I‚Äôm scared..."

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: break up, STIs, and consentI recently broke up with someone, and I'm having a lot of complicated feelings around it. I really enjoyed being with them, but had to break things off out of principle. We're both polyamorous and frequently talked about our other partners. After we had sex for the second time they shared with me that one of their partners is HIV positive. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and AIDS is still super scary to me, but I take PrEP and understand that if a person is undetectable and their partners use PrEP the chance of transmission is low. I understand the risk and have done my best to practice safer sex. I know I'm as safe as I can be, but I still hold a lot of fear, bias, and shame from my childhood around HIV/AIDS. What really hurt me about the situation was that they waited till after we had sex twice to tell me about their positive partner. I felt like my ability to make a choice about the level of risk I was comfortable with was taken away from me and it also put my other partners at risk. I'm also recovering from some trauma and being able to trust my partner during sex is really important. I feel like I lost that. So I broke up with them and explained what I did above. They tried to explain to me that they didn't do anything wrong and felt like their choice to wait to tell me was justified, but it just made me feel more manipulated. I feel like they didn't tell me because it would have impacted their chances of having a physical relationship with me. This is a new situation for me and I feel like I did what was right for me, but I can't stop thinking about what I would have done if I was on the other side of this. I feel like I would have been upfront before any sexual activity about an elevated risk and asked if they were comfortable with that. For those of you who are or have been in similar situations how do you handle them?"

"Posted in the MtF subreddit: Intense moment of telling the future? (CW - Surgery, genital dysphoria)Hey everyone so last night I was in bed unable to get to sleep and I had a sudden moment where I got this wave of **struggles to find the right word for 5 minutes** ... intense flash forwardness (idk what else to call it really) Basically, I felt like I was on a bed being wheeled out of getting SRS. I was able to see when I looked down that I 1) had bigger boobs, 2) Was wearing a hospital gown with a green medical sheet over me and 3) I knew I was going into a recovery ward. While it felt VERY real in that I know someday it's going to happen in the next few years and be a permanent change, it didn't feel scary really. Just very... right... but also intensely vivid. I didn't feel any loss of anything aside from my father, but I think that stems from me knowing there's a 99% chance he won't accept me when I come out. To me, this seems like some kind of deep, semi-conscious mental confirmation that I want and need SRS but at the same time I need to do some other stuff first such as tell my dad I'm trans and start hormones (November... in theory). I've wanted SRS for a long time now but this was by far the most intense moment of longing for it. The whole moment of feeling that lasted for only a few minutes at the most. What do you all think? Does this seem like my brain wants SRS but it's just practicality getting in the way for now? Or maybe I was just too tired and my brain was coming up with loads of crap / the barrier between the conscious and unconscious brain dropped for a minute? Thanks everyone!"

"Posted in the AskReddit subreddit: The birth of my niece, she was born when I was 17, I was extremely depressed and had planned on killing myself, even after I found out my sister was pregnant, but the came where my niece was born, a week later I held her for the first time and everything changed. I couldn't leave this world and take away the chance to be a good aunt, to be there for this new life. My niece is almost 5 now, she's smart and funny and talented, I'm her favourite auntie, I pick her up from school, we talk about princesses and the stars. I wouldn't change it for the world. A while ago I found the video log I was gonna leave her after I killed myself, I was silly back then. I deleted them and I will always be there for her. I'm still struggling with depression, but it's easier when I think about being there for my family, to be the cool aunt, for when my niece is a teenager and gets her heart broken, for when she needs advice about a boy or girl, or needs a place to stay because her mum and her had a fight.

Posted in the CasualUK subreddit: Regardless of what projectile is in the Canon you need to not fire it at a road or towards anyone or anything that could be harmed even remotely it's like on a movie set we would never ever point a weapon at anything. we would always point it at the ground in the little golden safety circle near our feet. On a movie set there should be nothing which is live and everything should be safe but accidents happen eg the film in Texas [RELATED: 'Texas'] that somehow a live round found its way into the chamber of a gun and killed the director. In the case of a cannon some wadding is required for that powder and often they will use sawdust to make it smoke a lot more and more dramatic. In my experience of firing cannons we always take precautions to ensure that the wadding doesn't shoot out the end or a particular large piece of sawdust or wood doesn't shoot out the breach. This has happened and does happen. I used to fire cannons regularly as a sailor.

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: Many consider agender to be a form of non-binary. However someone who is non-binary may still feel some kind of gender identity - exactly how they present that and experience it varies a lot. But often people I‚Äôve spoken to say they still feel something when they think about their gender. I‚Äôm agender so this is only based on my own experience - for me I just don‚Äôt feel anything when I think of my gender, there‚Äôs just a gap where I‚Äôm aware there probably should be something but isn‚Äôt. I am a person, further distinction feels meaningless to me. Other people tell me they feel things when doing certain things that affirm their gender, or feel right in how they present - I don‚Äôt experience any of that. I don‚Äôt experience dysphoria or euphoria. If I didn‚Äôt have social pressure on how people expect me to look I‚Äôd genuinely rather just not be perceived as any gender - just as me for what I do."

I worry about what people think about how I look, how I talk, how I act, how I live, my sexuality, everything. I‚Äôm constantly trying to trying to make other people happy but what about myself. I want to be happy. It‚Äôs like, I don‚Äôt want to die, but I just don‚Äôt want to feel the pain of this anymore. I want to be who I am and not judged. Not ridiculed. Not put down. Not looked at as different. I wish being gay was also normal. But it‚Äôs not. Every time I feel like something good is going good in my life, it gets ruined and something bad happens. I‚Äôm so confused and lost. I want to come out but I don‚Äôt want everything to change. People will think of me differently, I know they will. I know my friends will accept me, but my fear of losing my parents hating me for being gay scares me. They haven‚Äôt said anything bad nor good about gay people in my life. They just never brought it up. I‚Äôve been raised in a Catholic Latino household my whole life. It‚Äôs all about being manly and machismo. My dad is always talking about being a man and my mom is always hinting at me to girls as if she already knows I‚Äôm gay. But yet they constantly tell me how much they love me and that they‚Äôll love me no matter what. They fast forward a gay couple kissing on a show called Schitts Creek [RELATED: 'Schitt's_Creek'] but never fast forward on a show called Modern Family with a gay couple that kisses. It‚Äôs so confusing. They call me out on my ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù traits like my many facial expressions and hand gestures and say it‚Äôs a little ‚Äúawkward‚Äù. My mom told me months ago that I need more guy friends because I only have girl friends, but hasn‚Äôt said anything about my friends in forever. I feel like everyone knows I‚Äôm gay. It‚Äôs obvious but like I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôve recently saw a tweet that my sister liked on twitter and it was about Latino LGBT men and women same sex dancers (Folclorico). I mean, I guess that‚Äôs a good thing. She has lesbian coworkers and even stayed with them while she was looking for a house at one point. She has gay friends as well. I‚Äôm just scared about my parents. I don‚Äôt want to lose them. I love them and want them to love me back. I‚Äôm always thinking of alternate ways that my life could end up. I think maybe they‚Äôll still love me and maybe I can have a boyfriend around them, sometimes I think maybe they won‚Äôt accept me and think the worst, or there‚Äôs even times where I feel like I won‚Äôt even come out to anyone and just hide in the closet my whole life. I don‚Äôt know. Sorry about this. I feel trapped and suffocated and alone. I don‚Äôt want to be who I am and love myself. I just hate that I, and so many other people who may even have it worse, have to go through this."

"Posted in the school subreddit: School trip/conferenceHey guys. I am a 16 year old junior. I am part of this club about refugees and migrants. In April, the club advisor asked only me and my friend if we were willing to go to this conference during may. I told the advisor that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it because my passport is messed up and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it fixed by then. I was glad that I was out of feeling like I had to go. I didn‚Äôt want to go. However, a week later, the advisor told me that the conference was moved to September and asked if I could get my passport fixed by then. I obviously had to say yes because if I said no I would be lying. I really didn‚Äôt want to go but at least my friend was going to be there with me. But no. She messaged me and said that her parents said she couldn‚Äôt go. Now, I am going to be going all by myself to Mexico [RELATED: 'Mexico']. No family, no friends, no teachers.

A whole different country by myself with strangers. Just thinking about this is giving me so much anxiety. I am trying to find something to make up so that I can get out of this. I will not know anyone on this trip. If I was going with someone I knew then I would be more comfortable going but every time I think about it the more I don‚Äôt want to go.

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: They're cool with it. I've never really got any flack. Even before I was out I think the kids knew I was a little different and not like most men. The only time it gets difficult is when I'm dealing with boys for the first time who are tying to be super masculine. I present male, but have a lot of feminine characteristics. So when I walk up to them I look like a regular dude, but when I talk it's like speaking with Deanna Troi from Star Trek. I can sense their emotions, and I'm really good at getting them to think and talk about how they feel. That intimidates some boys and sometimes their reaction is to amp up the masculinity, but I don't play by those rules. I'm immune to whatever toxic masculinity stuff they might try. Soon they figure out that the only way they're going to get rid of me is if they talk about how they feel and work on being more empathetic. It's amazing how much more reasonable middle schoolers can be when you treat them like humans. Most middle schools just want someone to listen to them and make them feel like the world revolves around them. Once you do that they're on board with you. I've been a middle school teacher for a long time so working with and talking to middle schoolers is my specialty. Middle schoolers are actually super interesting. You're at the ground floor of them figuring out who they are and what their identity is going to be. You learn a lot about humanity when you see the beginning stages of it. I'm also an avid retro video game collector so having 10 or so old video game systems and a bunch of games in my room to play in the morning before school starts helps my street cred. Apparently kids like video games and people who know a lot about them."

"Posted in the feemagers subreddit: I'm gonna come out to my dad tomorrow. [TW] - Mental Illness, Suicide MentionI've known that I'm a trans girl since 2016. Since I was 11 years old. I felt uncomfortable doing boys' things. I hung out with girl friends. I gave little to no regard for gender roles. As time went on, I developed dysphoria. It was awful. I used to be able to shower without shocking at myself and crying. Eventually, I suppose the problem solved itself in a way I could conveniently ignore it. Of course, that was making me dissociate. Dissociation took me away from reality. To a little spot in my head where I could question my true beings of myself whenever I wanted. They became little voices in my head as I took control of my body, although failing. Every few months, I have to remind myself time has passed. I can't feel it anymore. All of these days are just a blur and I don't think that I exist. Quarantine came during this time, as well. At first, I was excited, but now I realize that I can't live through it as a boy. I texted the Trevor project, but it didn't help at all. I'm now aware that If I don't get professional help, then I'm going to die. So, this is my last stand. It's currently 2:33AM in Washington [RELATED: 'Washington,_D.C.'] state. I'm going to tell my dad at a time when it's just me and him tomorrow. If he takes it badly, I'm going to kill myself.

I told my mom and she said ""it's phase you always liked boys."" I joined the LGBT youth group, going off in secret. I had a mini fling with on the girls there but nothing came of it. Sometime later, I joined a support website for bisexual women, I made a handful of online friends in their chat room and on the forums. I clicked with one woman, we began talking outside of the site and became friends. There was casual flirting going on between us and several months later, my friend admitted she had feelings for me. I realized I liked her too and we dated for three years. It was a long distance and we did not get to see each other in person that much. That put a strain on things and I eventually decided that I was not happy with the relationship anymore. Over time, I realized that my romantic and physical attraction was centered on women and I didn't have thoughts or fantasies about men anymore. I came out again this time as lesbian/gay two years ago.My mom is still insisting I find a man to marry but my sister is cool with my sexuality. My friends that know are supportive as well.

"Posted in the gaybros subreddit: Heh, that's cute, I like that. Anyway I really wanted to jump into that thread (found it via the ""other discussions"" link in the /r/ainbow crosspost), but as usual, I found myself typing out a paragraph for you, coming back to it five minutes later and deciding not to post. I think that different people are at different stages of this, whereas you were advocating this notion that as soon as you come out of the closet, that has to look a certain way. I disagree. I think that (1) most people have some form of evolution into their queer identity, and (2) that identity can look like a lot of different things. I even think you went through some kind of evolution yourself. So I guess I took issue with you coming in and telling someone that they're ""bad at being gay"" just because they're not exactly where you happen to be or where you ended up. Privilege check time: I'm a gay dude in a big, liberal city so my sexuality isn't really a hinderance to me. I'm told I have passing privilege, which doubtless makes it easier for straight colleagues to consider me ""one of the guys"". Having said that, I'm out at work, and to basically everyone I know. When a friend makes a slur about queer people ‚Äî especially people who aren't like me ‚Äî I make sure to tell them it's not okay and have that discussion. In my personal life, I feel no shame about my identity; I hold hands with my boyfriend on the subway, talk openly about my sexuality and mod the second and third largest queer communities on reddit under my real name. But at the same time I don't feel the desire to rebrand myself a ""gay software developer"". I see no need to add mention of my sexuality to my bio or my resum√© (there's already mention of work I've done on queer issues), or even, for that matter, to set my Facebook status to ""interested in men"". Am I bad at being gay too?"

Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and the teacher got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on a classmate. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. He should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over him, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the teacher didn't agree with me. She KICKED ME OUT of the classroom, and I didn't even finish taking the test. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my cum after it already dried out and solidified on the carrpet. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean dried cum? You CLEAN cum after its FRESH out of your dick, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE.

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: Open Casting Call for an LGBTQ RPG Podcast/Video seriesHello! My name is Bijhan. I'm a trans Muslim game designer and author from Seattle [RELATED: 'Seattle'] who is currently [RELATED [RELATED: 'Uruguay']: 'Montevideo'] living in Montevideo, Uruguay. I've invented a science fiction tabletop RPG about time travelers fighting vampiric brain parasites which are trying to take over history. To promote the tabletop game, as well as the upcoming tie-in novel and strategy card game, and my little art collective which is producing these things, I thought it would be fun to actually play out the game with some cool and interesting people. My first instinct was to use my circle of friends, but they're all incredibly busy, [RELATED: 'Uruguay'] mostly on project for our art collective. Also, living in Uruguay, not everyone I'm friends with speaks fluent English. The actual recording process would be that we would all get on a Skype call (or something similar) and I would record everything from my end using video and audio capture. Then we would turn it into both a podcast and a YouTube video series. For that reason I'd like you to have a decent microphone. It doesn't need to be professional, mine is a headset with a built in microphone. But something more than the one built into your computer or phone would be preferable. The actual time commitment is not much. Maybe about three hours every two weeks to a month on the weekend. As for the actual ""audition"" process, I'd like to see your social media links so I can make sure you're not a right-wing troll and that you're actively engaged with an audience. Then I'd like to read some descriptions of characters you've played in the past in other RPGs at home, and what you enjoyed about the process of making and playing the character. If you don't have any tabletop RPG experience, just let me know that and maybe write about what you think you would like about playing one. I'm only looking for three participants, to keep things from getting too busy and convoluted. You can post your ""auditions"" below in the comment section, or use the old-fashioned direct mail system here on Reddit, but if you send me a chat message I won't get it because the client I use doesn't acknowledge its existence. Talk to you soon!"

Anyway, I've always called that part of the war a ""Come As You Are War"" or a ""BYOB - Bring Your Own Bullets"" war, because we were really under supplied. We were issued old style flack vests from the 90's, there were no grenades for our 203's, exactly 180 rounds issued to us but we had at most 3 magazines per person and each bullet had to be accounted for. We at one point were eating cold weather MRE's, had to place a guard on our motor pool at Udari because guys from 3rd I.D. were stealing our parts (the few we had), some of our trucks didn't have canvases and some we had were torn and trashed (I had to hand sew one back together so I had something to sleep under at night when I lived on the back of the truck for two months due to a tent shortage). We were issued water that was past its expiration date, when we got to go to the PX in those trailers, there was never the stuff you needed like batteries, but plenty of expired banana juice. I know our medics had to barter for supplies that we fortunately didn't need much to replace due to use. As engineers we had to scrounge for construction supplies like sandbags! I know the body armor part was common, but it seemed like we had nowhere near the supplies and equipment we should have had or were promised. I know logistics are always a problem in combat zones and aren't always guaranteed, but it seemed like were were scrounging for equipment and even food (breakfast t-rats for like a month, breakfast and dinner!). I get that infantry units probably needed the bullets and grenades more than we did, but it still seemed like we were vastly undersupplied. I just wanted to see if my experience was the same as others."

I realized I'm gay about three years ago, and in that time (looking back on it at least) I've been doing all I can to distance myself not only from my family, but from my home's culture (Red state [RELATED: 'Swing_state'], christian, etc.).

I've also learned how to speak French (If they don't know I'm gay I don't know what else to do) and that's really not like the very structured and 'murican' minds of my family. Whenever I hear someone talking with a country accent, I get completely turned off to what they have to say, I have a completely unfair bias against Christians sometimes, and overall I just don't like the things I see where I am. Even little things like climate drive me crazy and make me search for something different. I've been trying to do whatever I can, whether consciously or unconsciously, to not only distance myself from, but reject entirely the culture I've grown up in, and I think it has to do with the homophobia that I've experienced in my family and local culture. My question is if anyone knows what this is called, and/or if anyone else has experienced feelings like this? I would guess that things like this are common in the LGBT community, and that makes me think that the people here might have access to resources that I haven't heard of yet. I'm looking to do some research on it, and hopefully correct the problems I have in order to gain a little more respect for where I come from.

I'm talking about (forget the fact if he's masculine or fem, or a twink or a bear or nerd or a chub or a homo thug or brony, or a furry or hipster or bro or whatever) general gay men. Most of us go to work, knowing that we're a walking social experiment. Being a gay/bisexual man, and the stigmas and stereotypes that go with that. Straights can say ""I don't care what your sexuality is"", all that want. They know that's a load of bullshit. So stop. We may check out a gay bar or straight bar that's ""open minded"" after work and usually people form cliques that you're not apart of. Maybe on the weekends we go to a club or bathhouse to where it's hit or miss, but nothing is binding. If we're lucky during the summer we go to a pride or gathering or cruise, to where guys just walk around a resort stark buck naked and hookup etc. Some guys might join a gay softball/sports league, but from what I heard that's a facade. None of those guys can play to save their lives, and it's mostly a cover to exchange drama and bullshit in the community and to hookup. Dating is difficult. Men don't ask out other men in public. The devil is alive, I just noticed unless you're extremely lucky, no matter how many signs the guy is giving you and messing with your emotions, you ask him out it's always, ""I'm sorry I'm straight, we can still be friends."" etc. Even if it is a fucking guy who is attracted to other men you ask out. You're not his type, he still rejects you. He only wants to fuck because he doesn't want to date other men etc. I'll get onto dating and gay social media later. Our family either really hates us and disowns us, and we are banned from family events, lies and gossip are told about us, and it's ugly. Or our family loves us unconditionally and questions our lifestyle and warns us to be more careful and they think we are confused and are overprotective of us. Then we go onto social media as a last resort to try to conform or assimilate in to the community. ""Hey I'm a normal gay guy, I feel misunderstood, is anybody fucking out there?"" Reddit, youtube, instagram, tumblr, grindr, okcupid etc. It's just a big clusterfuck, and art is beauty, and beauty is fucking art. Deja vu all over again, and you can't win. Do you think AGB is representative of that? Because I assumed this was to help normal gay men and gay guys who want to talk about real issues. Because I'm 27 and I feel there isn't much to be proud of being gay. (I hate to mention my race but I am black and I feel I'm misunderstood and I would like to know there is someone out there that understands me.) Do you feel AGB is that representative?"

"Posted in the actuallesbians subreddit: ANOTHER question about dating trans women (cue drama)It's not a bad question I promise! Anyway... I'm trans and bi, and have had absolutely ZERO success with women. Period. I've dated other transwomen, but no ciswomen have *ahem* bitten my worm when I go fishing... It's got me wondering, I'm sort of kind of soft butchy. I wear official lesbian colors (plaid), Doc Martins or cowboy boots, don't paint my nails, simple make up, etc. Most of the transgirls I've seen have success with women seem to be more feminine. Now, I'm not opposed to skirts and (sensible) heels, but with the work I do, dressing very feminine (skirts and dresses) isn't practical when you're crawling under desks fixing computers. Now, it might be entirely selection bias on my part with seeing it this way. But I was genuinely curious about conducting a straw poll about those who are okay with dating transwomen; are you more attracted to lipstick trans, butchy trans, chapstick trans, or something else?"

I just dished out about 6,000 dollars on my braces, I still need to pay off my current semester at school and am about to start my next semester in January.

My local doctor takes it, but it knocks a 1200 dollar bill to a still higher 711. I really want to make that 535 go far for me. Is there any advice from anyone here on what I should do? I've already had four teeth pulled (due to crowding though) and really don't want to lose anymore. I need a dentist who is fairly cheap, does a well job, and takes Tufts PCP.

I'm a trans woman and my transition has been essentially stuck in first gear since it properly started in December of 2019. I've been taking voice lessons (though I never practice even though I live alone) and getting laser on my face. Putting effort into transitioning (makeup, voice work, clothes, etc.) can sometimes give euphoria, but often I just feel dysphoric and humiliated from it. I don't know, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I feel hopeless. And I feel like nobody (myself included) is ever going to *really* understand me as a woman? I just feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Somewhere in me I know I'm a woman, but my doubts about whether I am a woman, and the fear that I will put in tremendous effort and not be seen as such (on top of the dysphoria that comes from being a beginner at gendered things that makes me feel like shit) are *a lot*.

"Posted in the TwoXChromosomes subreddit: I disagree. While the jokes are vile and nasty to some, to many they are just jokes, humans have joked about fucked up shit for all of history. Dark humour is a thing . And that is okay , policing what people can and can't say or can and can't joke about is not good. There's people who joke about things and people who act on their twisted beliefs and unfortunately a minority of people who do both. You're not a ""snowflake"" for not liking or even being disgusted by things like that, different strokes for different folks . Those of us who are lucky enough live in a free and open society have the right to indulge in dark humour and twisted jokes . And I will be down voted for saying all of this. But I'm a gay transwoman , who fights for her right to be seen as a person everyday. I understand the issues and disgust . I dislike trans jokes , not my cup of tea but I don't want them gone I don't want people arrested or charged for saying them . If we start policing things like that we will fall down a hole we can't get out of and it'll turn very fast against us . Best we can do is try and spot those who are going to harm women, or any minority as fast as we can before anything happens. Taking away people's rights to joke about things won't help that."
"Posted in the gay subreddit: There's an important distinction between what one finds attractive vs what one idealizes that will help you thrive in the gay communityI think maturity in the pursuit of relationships stems from making the distinction between recognizing what one finds attractive and what one idealizes. The latter is this idealized form of a personal ""Michaelangelo's David"" inside one's head and the former is the umbrella of characteristics and interests that appealing to a person about a breadth of people. I also think that because we are gay we frequently judge ourselves how we fall short from our idealized idea of what a guy is and fail to recognize or undervalue what others find attractive about ourselves. A lot of of us may not be top of the statistical list (arguably most) in terms of the characteristics that gay men idealize but it doesn't mean we aren't attractive. I'm sure there's a perfect guy out there who's mostly tall. Has nice muscles (but not too much), who's smart and funny and socially capable. Who's kind and confident. It doesn't mean that there isn't a breadth of attraction in that we enjoy. I might find Michaelangelo's David the ideal man but it doesn't mean that my man has to be Michaelangelo's David. It's remarkable how far from Michaelangelo's David my guy is and I'm genuinely attracted to him and I'm in love with him. TL;DR: Just because you're not someone's favourite/ideal meal doesn't mean that they won't find you a perfectly tasty treat. TL;DR2: Just because something is first on the list doesn't mean that it's the only thing on the list."

"Posted in the polyamory subreddit: Meta Stuff Vent/AdviceHey all thanks in advance, mostly just want to vent and order my thoughts. So background. I am in a Triad with my two partners and everything is going really well. My nesting partner and I have been together forever and have a couple kids. My other partner has a great relationship with both of us, lives on her own and has another partner. She uses me more as a primary support for some of her family, mental health and more recently relationship issues, we've been seeing each other for two years and have been ""official"" for one. We practice non-hierarchical as best we can. This summer my nesting partner was out of town a lot of weekends and I was working, so I ended up spending a lot of time with my other partner and we were really able to have some great and beautiful moments of connection and fall in love all over and over and over again. It really helped me see and believe what a beautiful family we all make and that this really could work in forever terms. So there's some awkwardness, my newer partners family is not supportive and so I'm often helping them work through that, and also a bit more awkwardly she and her other partner are having some issues as well. I'm a reluctant support system here, because she doesn't really have anyone else to talk to about her relationship and i know it puts me in an ethically questionable position to give advice on my partners other relationship. My meta has caused me a bit of stress personally as well. I was spending a weekend with my partner and they took up a lot of my partners time trying to work through some issues that they had. I watched my partners mood go from one of the best and happiest i've seen into a 3 day depression after dealing with this. My meta knew that i was with her, knew that she was demanding time. My meta and i do have a relationship independently (talk and have drinks occasionally) I've been kinda annoyed that she hasn't said sorry for interrupting the date or anything after taking up hours of my partners time. There's been a few times where I've been asked by my partner advice on her other relationship with my meta and i've tried to give the best, most general ""relationship"" advice. trying to avoid specific of them and their personality and trying to keep it as high level as possible. I've always been biased towards supporting the other relationship as I do like my meta and I think she's good for my partner. Recently though my meta has been pushing my partner on the amount of time she gets. my meta seems to be pushing the same issue over and over and not listening to my partners boundaries. My partner has given them more time and energy and the pushing for more is still coming. My issue isn't with the ask that my meta is making, but she has started to compare my relationship with my partner to theirs and that's making the support part of what my partner is asking me for more awkward. How can i give my partner the support she's asking for and the advice on how to handle it, when I'm now one of the issues that's being brought up by my meta. I'm also a bit personally annoyed that the time i have and the relationship with my partner is being used by my meta to guilt my partner. Anyway - thanks in again for listening and if you have any advice. My planned course of action is to speak with my partner about my discomfort with the situation both from the advice side and from the metas use of my relationship as a point of comparison. I'll reassure my partner that they are loved and whatever decisions they make I'll be supportive of, but I think that my meta is pushing their boundaries in a way that's making me uncomfortable and that i should probably not give any further advice on the relationship as this has affected my bias. I'll probably also distance myself a bit from my meta until all of this settles. I couldn't be happier in my relationships and am feeling in no way threatened or hurt by all of this. Just concerned for my partner and feeling upset that I won't be able to help them through all this like I desperately want to. Thoughts?"

"Posted in the comingout subreddit: I think that not being a minority is always easier. So yes, being straight is easier with all things being equal. Sexuality though is not a choice so you have to learn to deal with the hand you are dealt. At your age if there had been a pill that made me straight I would have taken it. Decades later I have learned to appreciate my gay life. I certainly have much more empathy for those who are marginalized in society. My other family members including my two straight brothers don't share that characteristic. I don't believe if I was straight I would have that compassion. Right now your education is extremely important. It will allow you to take care of yourself for the rest of your life. If coming out impedes your ability to finish your education, then wait. Certainly, you need to weigh the emotional effects that being in the closet cause you because that can also impede your education. Consider finding other gay people in your school that you can share your frustrations. Friendships can't be solely based on a shared sexual orientation. That gets old quickly. But finding gay people that share some of your passions will bright your life up. Who knows, you may find a boyfriend."

I used to cut my wrists with a pencil in a very cramped room where the teacher of the said room could obviously see me, the room being roughly 3 meters long and wide. But clearly, I was the bad person here. Sorry I ranted a bit there, but now to the question. Would I be able to press charges?"

"Posted in the neurodiversity subreddit: I don‚Äôt really know a lot about RAD, but from a quick google search, RAD is all about the attachments. You don‚Äôt attach yourself to others, leading to withdrawn behaviour. Seems to also contain traits of the flat affect? (When you don‚Äôt show emotions.) Autism isn‚Äôt like this. We tend to be socially withdrawn, that is true, and we have difficulty expressing emotions in standard ways, but a lot of autism is processing issues instead of trauma responses. We tend to have sensory processing issues, we tend to have stimming as well. I think the confusion arouses from that in behaviours, we have a lot of overlap, but the reasons behind our behaviour is very different."
"Posted in the bisexual subreddit: Numbers, we are everywhereSo last summer I was working for a large government land agency. We were having a meeting with, IIRC, 16 of us there. I looked around the room. There was one large woman with a rainbow ring and a botched hair. One guy who was open secret gay, me (open secret at the time, now unavoidably open), an openly bi woman who had 2 boyfriends (yes, 3 somes the guys were also bi), an other gay woman though she was more feminine, and a woman who go drunk with me and the bi woman one night and told us she dated a girl in HS though she was dating guys at the time of this meeting &#x200B; Five of us of 16. About 1/3 for those of keeping track. So do you think this is typical? Note that all of us came from the far corners of the US thrown together for work. No community influences but the normal self selection based on job types. &#x200B; In another instance a girl friend of mine, totally straight, told me that she and one other woman were the only straight women on her woman's softball team. &#x200B; What about your work place, social club, sports team, or family? More or less accurate? Does it vary by industry or other social situation? I am curious to find out. &#x200B; One take away I have is that if we ever go to that horrible place like in Nazi Germany and we are fired or they refuse to hire us, the organizations would be crippled. &#x200B; &#x200B;"

"Posted in the homeless subreddit: UPDATE: No longer car living, still homeless (Black and gay)So I went back and forth as to whether I should post this, but I know I had a popular post last week, that garnered a lot of controversy, where I was screaming and crying for help, and had it not been for that, I would have not done this update. But I deleted my last post, as I was starting to get bullied by people in the homeless, vagabond, nomad community, and people were spreading lies, and falsehoods, and incorrectness, and myths, and fiction, about my situation (only proving my point being a homeless Gay Black single man), but I let the jerks win, and I deleted the posts, but yeah. As you know, I ran into car issues a few months back, and my car wouldn't start, and just a bunch of problems. With the car repairs; that I wasn't able to afford. I was trying to stealth camp in the streets of LA (like many people do) for several months, keeping my car immobile/not moving it from the space it was parked, until I could save up to fix my car. etc. I got my first ticket that I was aware of, the week before last. Ticket for my expired plates, and I couldn't afford the ticket, so I just set it aside for now. I mean, I knew had I done nothing to rectify my situation, my car was eventually going to get towed, but I just kept hoping I could get lucky and I would stay there. My luck officially ran out last week, and last Friday morning, (I only remember getting one other ticket, which I thought was my first ticket, week before last, as I said, but there must have been several that I have received; enough for them to threaten to tow the car, and people were throwing them away and taking them off my windshield or something smh, I don't know.) I took a nap, and woke up to see I had an additional ticket, that was even more expensive than the last one, and this ticket also said ""Car would be towed in 24 hours"". I initially freaked out, but I guess my luck came back, as thanks to the posts I made last week, an organization out of the blue reached back to me, and put me in a motel, where I am now. I just got the important things out of my car, and I understand Leticia (that's the name of my car lol), she was a good car at the beginning, but she was always ratchet, but I know I'll probably never see that car again, and it's fine. As I don't know if I'm going to be allowed any help to get the car out of impound, and pay the fees, and mind you, the car is still in need of repair so yeah. I kinda regret not accepting offers to sell it, but I know maybe I can salvage it at the impound lot and get something, but I don't know. I am allowed to stay here for a few weeks, in the mean time, they are looking into getting me into a housing program, and yeah. In the absolute worst, if I have to get a tent and be on the street for a while, so be it, but I'm just accepting the fact, car is out. Final words, I suggest anyone getting into living in your car if you're homeless; make sure you have a reliable car, that you have AAA membership, you have friends/family to turn to in case of extreme emergencies. Make sure you keep up with your car maintenance (oil, transmission, coolant, tires/tire pressure, spare tires, battery, emergency power generators/jumper cables, steering, brakes, starter/alternator etc.). Make sure you have funds for emergency repairs. Understand if you're a homeless car/van lifer, it only takes a minute/a day for your situation to get scary, like me, and yeah. So that was my update. It's just me, and I have no friends or family support; I don't have anyone but myself, and I have to work on myself. I am still homeless, and working with my case workers to improve my situation. I will use this time to rectify my life, as to what I'm going to do. But it's so long car living, it was a good 18 months. The good, the bad, the ugly, the learning experiences. But, it was something. So yeah. Thank you. :)"

"Posted in the MtF subreddit: Since I've never had a cis vagina, (and I doubt that your mom has ever had a cis penis) an apples to apples comparison is gonna be impossible. What I can say is that it's different. For me, genital dysphoria was off the charts, I even used to tuck and rub to masturbate to the point that I barely even got hard. Toward the end, it was basically a vestigial body part. It was never about the feeling, it was about fixing a birth defect, a biological aberration that was detrimental to my mental health. Your mom (and a lot of other cishets) still think that it's about sex, it's not. Sex with my partners is amazing because I love them and it makes me so happy that I can share and enjoy the body I have with them. I could never have sex with the body part I used to have, this is a million times better than before I had the surgery. You said that you wanted penile preservation vaginoplasty, that's what two of my partners have had. Their reason for getting it was because they never felt that having only one of either set of genitals was right. Gender for them was incredibly hard, and still is to a certain extent. They just do not understand binary gender. It's like trying to explain Quantum physics to a layperson, they're never gonna get it. This is a very long winded way of saying do what YOU think you need to feel comfortable in your own body. That's the only opinion you need. You can try to explain it to your mom, cuz she is family. But at the end of the day, if she doesn't get it, that's not going to change the way you think about yourself. And as always, YMMV"

"Posted in the MtF subreddit: A Kink unlocked my burried disphoryaPossible trigger So about a 18 months to a 2 year so I got disphorya bad, i mean bad, it would drain me just to understand it, I would lose hours fighting for control of my own imagination because all my brain wanted was to be a girl and was almost rejecting the real world (it was like my brain was saying ""you were not Born a girl so you can't be happy""), couple this With university stress, living aways from home isolated, and extream depression and I ended up just blocking it out. Anyway after I blocked it out I stoped getting any type of disphorya at least not directly, it was there just more like a puppy in a cage with a blanket over the top, it's been like this almost a year and a half now now, and I had wanted it back for a while, it's like my brain knows it wants something or click With but it can't reach it, this is where the kink comes in. (Also I used to struggle with feeling back for having kinks like this while being trans but I realized I'm still me I'm just more kinky me) So jump forward to 2/3 weeks ago, IV been pushing my kinky side A LOT more past 8 month's since I for a sex drive again, i had no sex drive in university at all but tons of kinks that I never felt like doing or trying, all of this despite having a BF who was loving but had a massive drive, anyways over the past year I have been doing more stuff, getting over my fear of sex and exploring my kinks, and as of past few weeks IV gotten more into bimbofcation and sissy hypnosis, normally I would not bother with Hypno nbut I found myself getting more into the ideas of the link and looking at more video's, I then started listing to some soft tracks at night while trying to sleep, I enjoyed them and unlike everything else found them working and relaxing, cut forward to a few days ago and my disphorya is back with a vanddeta that i locked her up. She's not as bad like Back when it was really bad, then it was wanting to be a girl but more emotionally and experience wise, I could do makeup and dress and it made me happy but it was the emotional side craved the most, now it's both, I find myself wanting to dresses girly and it makes me happy, but in a non sexull way, was originally assumed it was a overactive drive again but no, it's just wanting to be the girl I am, its that feeling, my disphorya finally got let out after I burried her well over a year ago, I know a kink is not the best way to do this but it was a unintended side effect of exploring a kink, and it has unlocked part of me that I hid away and I could not be happier, I still enjoy the kinks but I now know that I am whole again, even of the part that has come back after I tried to hide it."

When I was growing up we still had Section 28 in our schools, this meant there could be no mention of or 'promotion of homosexuality', teachers would ignore any homophobic or transphobic bullying out of fear of getting fired for intervening and there was nobody you could ask about why things didn't quite seem right compared to what friends would talk about. Didn't stop any of us being LGBTQ+, but sure as hell made it a very difficult and long journey to figure it all out (took me into my mid-20's to accept I wasn't straight, took me until my 30's to realise I was agender). I know things still have a long way to go in many places but it's good to see there's more support and knowledge in schools now (mostly), and places like this sub and other online communities for people to get advice, learn about the community, and find people who understand when often those IRL do not. It's one of the reasons I became a mod was to help protect spaces like this due to how helpful they can be to so many people.

"Posted in the BisexualMen subreddit: My experience as a teacher who's been in the field for nearly 12 years is that in general there are very very few out teachers. I know other LGBTQ teachers and they are afraid to talk about their spouses, it's hard for them to advocate for their rights, and they are afraid of parents thinking they are predators. Straight teachers have little to none of those worries. The largest hurdle we have is that people sexualize LGBTQ folk and think that's all we're about. Which we all know isn't true. They also think that being something like having a rainbow flag mug is being ""political"". I can be in the closest and present as ""straight"" and run the GSA club, but the moment I come out and run it I have an agenda. It's hard because kids hear and see that being an LGBTQ person is something that should be hidden and kept secret. When I was in the closet and teaching at a school where teachers couldn't be out my students organized a Day of Silence to highlight how their voices as LGBTQ students and allies were ignored and silenced. That was probably one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen a group of students do. Seeing how much they wanted their voices to be heard and how much they wanted to be seen really made me think about what I could to make their lives better. Later after I left the school because we moved out of state I meet with the student who organized that protest and thanked them for helping me find the courage to be myself and come out. Since that day I have worked hard to educate myself on how I can be an ally to those students and advocate for them so they can be their authentic selves. There was someone who left a comment further down who said I should be fired for being an out teacher and that I'm hurting the bi male movement because I'm ""out and proud"" in front of my students. I have pretty thick skin, working with teenagers for as long as I have teaches you to not take things too personally, but hearing someone question my professionalism and say that I'm hurting my students is one of the most painful things a person can say to me. It makes me angry, and it makes me want to get loud. You're looking for bi male voices? Well mine is fired up right now and I have a lot to say about what it's like to be in the trenches with young LGBTQ people. Kids who are trying to survive in a hostel environment that says they can't be themselves. I can tell you all about how toxic masculinity and misconceptions about gender norms can infect a boy and turn him into a bully. I wish that I could be a unique voice, but the reality is that I'm not. There are probably 1000s of other LGBTQ and ally teachers who can tell you the same stories. Thank you for posting this because it's galvanized my resolve to be a vocal advocate for our young LGBTQ siblings and it's made me even prouder of who I am for finding my voice as a bi male."

"Posted in the askgaybros subreddit: Because I've never had a positive experience. I've been teased many times (especially from straight men) but I've never had a boyfriend and I'm 32, for all intents and purposes, I am inexperienced/a virgin, and I can't honestly think of any positive experiences, except maybe about handful of years ago, I was in my late 20s I suppose, a Fed Ex driver (middle aged White guy) complimented my outfit, (I was on my way to my volunteer job at the LGBTQ center in Long Beach [RELATED: 'Long_Beach,_California'], and I wearing a vest, tie, and shorts with some loafer shoes on) and I told him thank you. But since then, nothing. I feel I'm getting uglier as I age, I feel when I was in my 20s, I felt better about myself, and I still feel I look nice now, but no I have had little, to virtually no positive experiences, so that's why I'm scared, that people aren't putting any faith in me, so yeah."

Posted in the lgbt subreddit: It's okay. I was raised in multiple foster homes and I never wanted to come out because I knew in a few weeks I would be in a new home and I didn't like the idea of coming out multiple times to new people but I have a more permanent home now and I finally came out with somewhat supporting people but for some people they were raised with people who were against lgbt and so it's okay that as a transgender person you steal have transphobia. Because you can't fully grow out of what you were taught. In all of my homes I was taught the same thing. That what ever happened to me was my fault. I know that it's wrong now because it was never my fault but there is still a part of me that thinks everything bad in my life was my fault. My point is if you were raised by people who poured their opinion onto you then no matter what that opinion will stay with you in the back of your head and it'll never go away but what you can do is change that way of thinking

One of my closest friends is transgender and schizophrenic. So‚Ä¶. we do exist. How can you tell? I‚Äôm not really sure, but to me, given that I am the one most frequent, and that most of us are in some way or form masculine, it makes sense to identify ourselves as trans. So, with Tom, firstly is he you? As in, can you talk to him? Is he separate? Or are you both Tom and Claire? Because the latter seems to be more indicative that you‚Äôre not split. Does this help at all? If you are split, have a conversation with him and decide on the future of the body. That‚Äôs what we did anyway."
"Posted in the MtF subreddit: First Pool Party InvitationI recently received my first pool party invitation since starting HRT five months ago.

Depending on how I dress(unless someone knows I'm transitioning) my breast development doesn't seem to attract anyone's attention, but I certainly haven't gone around topless. The party is going to pretty LGBTQ friendly, so that will not be an issue. How did you handle your first public unveiling?"
"Posted in the TransSupport subreddit: It was easier before I started my transition (by ‚Äúit‚Äù I mean everything). I had a beautiful wife, six figure job, kids, a house in suburbia [RELATED: 'Suburb'], [RELATED: 'Europe'] vacations in Europe‚Ä¶ I was living the dream. Except, it wasn‚Äôt my dream. I kept trying to keep the facade up and kept trying to stay hidden - the energy expended was massive and this had an impact on those closest to me through my selfish response to being terrified. I wanted to transition at 23, 27, 30, 35 and one night when I was 39 I told my spouse I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I halted transition attempts previously because I was terrified of losing my marriage, losing my family, always being seen as a freak and losing my job. My marriage was over within days. Divorce is a horrific experience but I am grateful to be on the other side five years later. I have grown so much and I don‚Äôt think I would have experienced and understood myself as a Queer Trans Woman to the level I did had I remained in that marriage. I don‚Äôt see my kids as much as I want to but, when we are together, they get ALL of me not just the part that is pretend. I have family and friends that I lost along the way. It hurts. Sometimes it was their choice and sometimes mine. The beautiful thing is the people who enter your life or the existing relationships that become deeper. Also, chosen family is a beautiful concept. I did lose my job but not for being Trans - my entire division was eliminated- looking for work was really scary and really difficult and it became compounded due to Covid. I am still in my field and still in the same sort of role in sales and have never experienced significant issues professionally other than the occasional misgendering that is a slip up and quickly corrected. An early goal was to pass. I would dismiss thoughts of transition for years for fear of not passing. I don‚Äôt pass. I stick out and am clocked all the time. I am looked at as a Trans Woman and never seen as a Woman. Ultimately, Trans Liberation isn‚Äôt about assimilation or adopting patriarchal ideals of femininity, it‚Äôs about expressing yourself freely and living your identity in a world that doesn‚Äôt want us to exist. But safety. I wish I had understood the safety and security of being a mediocre cis-het white man where I could walk where I wanted or throw down if I needed. Going to my car after the gym was never anxiety inducing or having a man get into my elevator when I am travelling alone and getting off on a different floor than mine so he doesn‚Äôt know what floor I am on. Safety. Sometimes those feminine ideals of the patriarchy need to be adopted to blend in more easily and camouflage oneself to be safe. The closet and dysphoria lie to you. It feels comfortable in the secrecy of the closet because you think of all the scary reasons you can live your authentic life - and they are scary - but sometimes when you are standing at the edge of the ocean and you don‚Äôt know know how deep it is, you got to jump in anyway even if you‚Äôre scared. Good luck, enjoy the ride. The water is fine. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"

"Posted in the AskReddit subreddit: I'm Colorado at the Buckley Air Force Base we have these giant golf balls that are probably several stories high. As a kid I asked my Dad what are in those and he said ""Vader, to keep an eye out for enemy missiles and planes"". For far too many years I imagined Darth Vader's head spinning in there with his eyes looking in each one wondering why that was more effective than radar and why did it have to be the shape of his head instead of just using his eyes or did they need the shape of his head to use the force and why could the force only be used to sense missiles and planes why not do cooler stuff with it? Then I realized I'm my late teens he probably said ""Radar"" and I'm an idiot."
"Posted in the bisexual subreddit: First of all, I also hope to live in the world where coming out isn't a big deal and the fact that it wasn't for you is awesome. It gives me a lot of hope. Who people are and aren't attracted to shouldn't be a big deal. I'm not looking for special attention because I'm bi. I'm just looking for people to see the whole me now and realize that I've grown beyond what I was in the past. When you've lived almost half of your entire life repressing yourself and you break free of that it is kind of a big deal on a personal level. I'm super proud of that and I want to talk to the people closest to me about it. &#x200B; I think one of the things I'm trying to tease out in this entire discussion is that the coming out experience for someone who is older might be a little different than someone who's younger. I'm not saying one is easier or harder. They are just different experiences. I have friendships that are older than you are and that means that there's a lot of history there. I think it's also very different for parents when you're older. My mom felt really sad and felt like she failed me as a parent because I had to keep that part of me a secret for so long. So I have to also talk to her about why that's not true. That she was a great parent and that it was society in the 80's and 90's that caused me to not realize who I was. It's a weird role reversal when you have to be the one doing the consoling and finding a therapist so you parent gets the help they need to process everything in a healthy manner. &#x200B; As for my friends, I think we grew up in a different time and you just didn't talk about LGBTQ issues. Most of them just aren't prepared to have those conversations because they didn't grew up having them. That's why when I hear stories about people your age coming out and it not being a big deal it's awesome. &#x200B; I also don't want this to sound like coming out was a horrible experience for me. It was quite the opposite. It was by and large positive and fantastic. It's just that one little comment that takes me back a bit."

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: You could definitely be trans with only top dysphoria. You could also have body dysmorphia (not sure how to spell that). Either way, if your feeling this way it's probably best that you seek out advice from a doctor or similar. I use to feel similarly and eventually put everything together from my past actions and thoughts and found out that I was indeed trans with primarily top dysphoria. You may be entirely different, and that's fine. If you want to experiment with your gender and figure it out yourself, definitely go for it. Maybe try presenting as male and see how you feel about it, does it make you feel good, or does it make you feel bad (minus the feelings of nervousness as you wont be used to it and may feel worried at first)."

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: i am genuinely afraid of young cishet menHi! I'm (18, transmasc) gonna be going to University soon and im kinda panicking cause i am gonna be living in a dorm. For context i am also autistic and have social anxiety, so socialising is already difficult for me, but what makes it extra terrifying, is that there is a huge likelyhood i'll be placed in a dorm with a cishet dude and im so fucking scared. I have spent my whole life surrounded by girls of all ages, gays, and old men, so i know how to communicate with them, and apart from old men, everyone is pretty safe to be around for me. And since i have been around a lot of abusive older men, even though i don't particularly trust them, i know how to handle them...but guys my own age... I have no idea what to do with them. I've never really had any guy friends so i don't really know how to talk to them, which is scary enough on it's own, but then there's the aspect of safety. I know there are decent cishet guys who aren't homophobic or transphobic, but 99% of cishet guys my age that i've met have been really awful to me and have traumatized and assulted me, so i find it really hard to trust them. I am already scared of the thought of having to share a room with someone because...people are scary in general, but the likelyhood of being put in a room with a homo/transphobe is ridiculously high, and im currently living in an abusive household where i have to be hyper aware of the people around me and their moods to protect myself, so the thought of that situation following me to uni is freaking me out. I am sorry if this was a shitty way to word my feelings but i just needed to get this off my chest"

We are both Seattle [RELATED: 'Seattle'] based musicians, I'm getting up in the scene, she's getting to the top. She asked me to manage her due to my knowledge of the music industry and my organizational and communication skills. She has her own projects, tours regularly, plays drums for AAA national acts, and is a part of around 8 bands in the area. It's important to note here she asked me manage her, not a band. She's not making much money at the moment, but I foresee her doing well for herself in the coming years. I would take a bit of a pay hit for the first year or so, but I believe it would pay off in the long run. I see this right now as a medium risk investment. Some of the work we discussed does not involve a percentage, but rather an hourly rate. Or a weekly amount. I'm going to lay out my terms soon and we'll negotiate from there. I had planned on managing artists in my future, but not this soon in my career, I want to take the position for more than just a paycheck. It for experience as well. The amount of projects she has going on is intense and I understand why she is seeking management. I feel like I know how to manage a band, but not an individual of this type who has multiple projects. How would you approach my situation? What would be the best course of action?

"Posted in the comingout subreddit: As a cisgender man I may not be the best to respond but I will share my opinion for what it is worth. I think we spend way too much time deciding what is feminine or masculine. If I like cooking or decorating that doesn't make me any less a man or more of a woman. The clothes we choose to wear for comfort or style don't define us. If you want to hunt deer in a camo skirt and pumps that doesn't make you any less of a hunter, less of a man, or a women. Do what you enjoy because you enjoy it not because a society says you should or shouldn't. If labeling yourself makes you feel better than certainly put a label on it. You can always change it if it no longer meets your needs. People will always find a reason to judge us. The people that really love us will support our choices."

I'm 21, sold my 2001 Cadillac Eldorado for $1,500 to a middle aged couple, a couple weeks ago, as is. Title signed, bill of sale signed. Some known problems but nothing major. I told the buyer everything that was wrong to the best of my knowledge, which wasn't a whole lot, nothing major. He test drove it and was very happy with it, bought it the next day. As he was driving home he texts me saying the heat's not working, blinkers aren't working, lights aren't working, and radio won't turn on. This is all news to me which I obviously tell him, a couple more texts back and forth until I basically end it with a ""shit happens"" (paraphrasing there). I thought all was well until tonight I get a very angry text from the buyer saying theres a load of problems and $900 worth of work needs to be done to it. Accusing me of selling him a lemon he threatens to sue, stating his father is lawyer. Going back and forth, all these problems again being new to me, didn't seem to quell him.

"Posted in the asktransgender subreddit: When I started I was 5'5 and about 110 lbs, definitely underweight.

After about 6 months of HRT there was still a really noticeable decrease in strength, I used to be able to carry the week's groceries a couple blocks home and now that was practically impossible.

"Posted in the MtF subreddit: Exploiting my gender identity to further my career in music? Bear with me.I'm early in my transition, and you've probably seen my posts here before asking about singing. I try to make my living with my male voice, it has a great tone and I've spent many years perfecting and sculpting it to get the tone I desired. Singing to me is my passion, and I'm scared that if I throw it away to transition, I'll be just as depressed as Claire not being able to perform. As an artist, both visual and musical, I guess I could consider myself lucky that I'm in a gender grey profession. If you look at artists, you'll find that many are non gender conforming, or at least open about their gender expressions. However, I'm not quite in a music field that is as grey, folk, but it's still there. So, do I be Claire 24/7 and sing as Mike? Do I exploit this as an extra layer of entertainment, degrading myself to achieve some amount of success? Do I advertise myself as a tranny or freak to pike peoples attention? Going this route though, I don't think I'd ever been seen as a woman, and rather a very effeminate man with boobs. (hrt possibly in the future) This concerns me because well, if I'm never seen as a woman, why do I want to only make it harder on myself. I rarely have dysphoria, but when it hits, it hurts, bad. And I'm told I pass well to an extent without HRT, however I feel that may change as the years go on. I'm at a loss of what to do. I'm at a crossroads, and I don't know how to cross the street. I just moved to Seattle [RELATED: 'Se [RELATED: 'Michigan']attle'] from Michigan yesterday because I was thrown out of my parents house. So I have a fresh start here.

Which is why I'm nervous to explain that I don't feel right as a 'girl' and that I want to be a man. I don't think it's that he doesnt believe people with those issues exist, I think that it's more of him thinking people are overreacting and he things it's just 'being sad' or 'being nervous.' Hes never tried to convince me to stop my anxiety meds so I dont feel in danger talking about these things with him. I just need to try being concious of the way I tell him about things and trying to explain them in a different way."

Needless to say, I'm not convinced her best friend would often be a gay guy. I also have to consider that I'm not the most physically attractive person, so sometimes it's hard to be outgoing here (don't fill the comments with ""I'm sure you look fine,"" or things like that.

That would be dehumanising, at least that's how I feel.. I am Nonbinary, my body is female. I let many people just use female pronouns.. that makes it easier for them.. and I can tell you, it is fucking anxiety triggering and uncomfortable as hell to correct people when they use the wrong pronouns so it makes it easier for me too.. Most of the days I don't really mind.. but some days it makes me so anxious and dysphoric that I just feel like crying all day.. or like i'm steering into an anxiety attack.. As a result I asked some of my friends to use ""en"" as a pronoun. It's a neo pronoun from Austria [RELATED: 'Austria'] and the only real alternative I found until now.. it's making me feel so much better about myself on especially hard days.. and I just wished that everyone would use it.. That it would come naturally to people.. and not like I'm asking too much of them.. But until now I've only told 5 people about my new pronouns.. Because I'm scared of reactions like yours. Reactions that show the huge amount of selfcenteredness and the lack of effort and empathy that it needs to disregard another person's wellbeing so much. So yes, as much as I'd wish there were neutral pronouns to begin with to make it easier for everone, there just aren't.

My other job at another center I was fired because I didn‚Äôt acknowledge a parent on a severe migraine day towards the end of my shift. I thought I could hold out because we were short staffed that day. Also idk what kind of job you work in, but if you‚Äôre comfortable, have a talk with your supervisor, let them know what‚Äôs going on. With my boss at one of my centers we were able to come up with a plan of attack if my migraines got really bad- I had cokes and granola bars stocked in her office so none of my coworkers would eat them and I could ask to take like a 10 minute break in the dark quiet basement if I needed to (and we had someone to cover for me) but most important thing is LEARN YOUR LIMITS.

I used to work in the veterinary field as a vet assistant and vet tech and most veterinarians are either indifferent to the matter or just think that it's an effective way to stop cats from scratching
Posted in the Asexual subreddit: Yeah it really does piss me too. My friends are all supporting of me being ace and I‚Äôm not out to my parents. Thankfully people rarely say stuff like this to me but it does annoy me when it does happen.
"Posted in the LGBTeens subreddit: [Rant] Yeah my hallucinations are getting worse, I feel invalidated every fucking second, I have sudden outbursts of Satan-knows-what emotion and I'm losing my will to live.TW: Self harm, graphic descriptions, violent shit basically (+cursing) It's probably not a matter of interest to any sane person, but I feel comfortable sharing this stuff with the only family I know, cuz I'm afraid I share blood with bigoted fucking people. The only comfort I ever feel is when I remember that I'm a part of a community like this. I'm a cold person; if not at heart then at speech. This whole thing is gonna sound as dead as fidget spinners, so please don't torture yourself if you've already had a bad day. So my emo phase is lasting a bit too long. I've been very upset about shit lately. I'm losing will to do any fucking thing. I'm working my arse off to get decent marks but I'm so trash at the stuff that I'm still gonna end up failing. That's not even the point of this. I try to ignore any kind of intrusive thoughts I have, but it gets harder by the second to do so. All I think about is having friends who I can actually see in real fucking life. Don't get me wrong, my friends are the absolute best, but it still sucks a lot when I can't see anyone, and HAVE not seen anyone for a log fucking time. I'm wasting my life away listening to ""supportive friend asmr"" cuz I haven't heard anyone's voice for years, unless you count my parents who I hate even calling family at this point. Yeah, ridicule me all you want, but I'm doing anything to distract myself from the fact that I'm not gonna have any kind of company for years. You might ask how I'm sure of that. My school is the last bacterium that's left in those sanitizer ads. It's full of transphobes and shit. And I'm not a pleasant sight, so my face is often the topic of conversation among the pretty people. Yeah I write about that stuff way too much. Sorry about that. My hallucinations are progressively getting worse. I talk to non- existent shit and get surprised when I realize what the actual fuck I'm doing. I see these figures looming at the corner of my eye, and it drives me insane, as if I'm not crazy enough already. I hear voices that influence my actions, and I try to distract myself from them by listening to music. But sometimes it doesn't work, and a few hours ago I almost ended up decapitating myself. I'm being serious, I was pulling my hair and clawing at my ugly face like a maniac. Sometimes I have these sudden outbursts of random shit. The most prominent one if where I start screaming like a really bad black metal singer. I lose control over myself. I hate it. I hate every part of it. I have very violent thoughts. I think about my body boiling in water. I think about sucking on my own blood. I think about my head being roasted on a fucking grill. I think about cutting so much that I lose my arms. I think about tying the noose so hard my face turns blue. I know, absolutely repulsive shit. I don't have any will to live. None at all. I can't wear what I wanna, I have no social skills, I have fucked up imagination, I become a fucking wolf and scream my throat out, I annoy my friends at fucking 4 in the morning. I hate being who I am right now. Some of it is probably not my fault, I know, but my personality is absolutely trash, as you can clearly see here. I can't dedicate any time to my interests. Both because I have to study so fucking much and also because I'm losing control over my actions. I'll jump off my balcony and won't fucking realize it. My notebooks are a fucking mess, my appearance is shabby, my will to live is non- existent. I overthink everything. I can't ignore shit, no matter how hard I try. I write too much, I wouldn't be surprised if y'all hate me. It's February the 10th, 2021: Note to self- I fucking hate you. That's all. Sorry for making y'all go through this. Peace."

Posted in the legaladvice subreddit: We have a daughter with shared custody and I just want to feel safe in my home and if possible protect my daughter. He's never done anything to hurt her so there's absolutely no evidence there. I was just hoping that there was any hope at all. I'm hoping to get some sort of protection order but I worry that I'll come up short and he will spend the time after terrorizing me.

Posted in the WhitePeopleTwitter subreddit: I hate the American politics system. It's build for fascism. It's so damn easy to get the shittiest people in to run the whole thing. The electoral college needs to go. The First Past the Post needs to go. We need a parliamentary system or something. Have a liberally social/fiscally conservative (D) and far radical conservative (R) nationalist party is not ideal for a country as big as ours.
"Posted in the latebloomerlesbians subreddit: I feel like I missed the boatI began to realize my attraction to other women around 9 years ago. I got a huge crush on a classmate of mine when I was going to community college. I thought since I have had experiences with both men and woman, and would consider a relationship with either gender, I thought I was bi. I was able to form a relationship with a woman I met online which went from friendship to my first real romance. We dated for 3 years but after so many complications, I ended it. It will be 5 years this fall since the break-up and I have played around with dating apps and even got a few in person dates and all of these dates were with women. I began reflecting on my past experiences with both men and women. I came to the revelation that my feelings and relationships with women were much more intense than the feelings I had for men. My first real love was my ex-girlfriend. I did date a guy when I was 20 before my lady crush but I think what I liked about the relationship was the fact that he was the first man that took a real romantic interest in me. I went along with it because I thought in time I would grow to love him. Things ended abruptly with him because he ended things by just not calling me anymore. In retrospect, I did things when boys/men because it is something that most people expect women to do. I am also of Jamaican descent which means that my mother has echoed some very homophobic views towards me. She hates the fact that I like women and when she finds out that I am not bi and just a full blown lesbian, I know my relationship with her will be in major jeopardy. As of now, I have only told a handful of friends about my change in labels, They have all been supportive. I am so glad I figured out all this stuff before I ended up marrying some dude just appease my family and society. I will be turning 32 in March I worry at times that I don't have plenty of time to be able to form the kind of life I want which is a big lesbian stereotype. I want to find love with an amazing woman, get married, have children and adopt all the cats. I feel so far behind my peers and I hate that it took me so long to come to terms with my sexuality. Compulsive heterosexuality messed me up big time. Do any of you have some words of wisdom and or advice for me?"
Posted in the traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns subreddit: So I'm white and don't use it/its and I'm just going to say that now but I am friends with a POC and a person who uses it/its and I have heard them have conversations about and this is basically what it comes down to it. Generational trauma is something that is still very prevalent in the black community and so hearing it/its (which while has been used against trans people it was/is mainly used against POC specifically black people in America [RELATED: 'United_States']) can cause distress in a black person without them truly understanding why. My black friend is also trans and for them they don't mind my other friend using it/its AS LONG AS they don't have to use them (which works out because this friend has multiple sets of pronouns besides it/its) but that's one black person among many. I've met other black people who have said they rather not hear anybody refer to another person as it just because it causes the part of their brain that goes back to slavery to kick into overdrive and can cause a lot of fear. So do with this information what you will.
"Posted in the BisexualMen subreddit: Right, thats what we are trying to stay away from, there are so many more aspects to our lives as bi men, and we want this page to be all about support and advice"
"Posted in the ask_transgender subreddit: Has anyone made you question your entire mindset on being trans?I don't know if that is the right way to phrase this post or not, so hear me out. I'm still in the process of coming to terms with being transgender and I cant stop thinking about all the scary things I'll have to face. I'm a very pessimistic person, sorry. But was there anyone in the beginning of your transition that made you feel like you were doing it for the wrong reason, or you didnt think it through, or any other shitty feeling? And how did you get through it? I think my shitty brain needs the validation that shit gets hard sometimes but it doesnt matter. I'm still in the process of learning to love who I am as and I guess I need to see the scary parts first."
"Posted in the LosAngeles [RELATED: 'Los_Angeles'] subreddit: Robbed at gunpoint in Long BeachI was going back and forth to posting this thread, or even telling the police. But I will file a police report about it this morning. You guys all know, well some of you know, I'm a flamboyant african-american young man. Last night getting close to midnight, I was walki [RELATED: 'Long_Beach,_California']ng in downtown Long Beach very close to the 5th street blue line station. This man who was walking in the opposite direction of me grabs my attention. Being the social person that I am, I figured he wanted change for the bus or whatever etc. Congruently and instantaneously, I receive a call or text on my phone a few seconds before he calls after me so I instinctively pull my phone out. In that moment when he has my undivided attention, he pulls out what looked like a 9mm handgun and aims it at my head and robs me. I decide to give in as material things can be replaced, your life cannot. I then walk around (being that this is later at night not that many people are out) and ask three separate men if I can use their phone to call the police after telling them I was just robbed at gunpoint. They all refuse and look at me crazy so I then in a state of shock and paranoia and disbelief, decide just to walk home. I'm still at home shaken and was still in debate to post about this event. I am even afraid and in fear of my life of posting this, but I feel the need to. I don't know if a [R [RELATED: 'Los_Angeles']ELATED: 'Long_Beach,_California']nyone has any experience on this or anything. But Long Beach/LA please be aware of your surroundings. Don't flash your belongings in public or in your car. If you are walking alone there are strength in numbers. If you see something say something. The guy was Black, in his mid/late 20s. Wore a dark blue/black hooded sweatshirt that had white letters or graphics on it. He had the hood around his head. Had on transparent or brown glasses with big lenses."

I really need to do something tomorrow. My problem is that I'm really lacking the motivation and also the energy. I am so fricking exhausted all the time, no matter how long I sleep.

"Posted in the relationships subreddit: Why would my [27M] dad [69M] have such severe anger issues?My [27M] dad [69M] has had really bad anger issues for as long as I can remember. His anger seems to have gotten worse over the last few years - but even more so since he retired back in 2020 (just before the pandemic really started to make itself known). My dad is the fourth of eight siblings. He has one older brother. two older sisters, two younger sisters and two younger brothers. Sadly, one of his younger sisters passed away just two days after her first birthday. My dad lived in a somewhat abusive household. His dad was the abuser in thr household. He was abusive to my dad, one of his brothers and two of his sisters. His dad also had a really bad temper - and would lash out at the nearest person. My dad‚Äôs mum knew about the abuse, but didn‚Äôt do anything about it. For some strange reason, my dad and all of my aunts and uncles maintained a strong relationship with their mum. Some people say that people tend to learn anger issues from at least one of their parents. However, my dad is the only person out of him and his siblings that have severe anger issues. He gets really pent up over the smallest things. Sometimes, he even gets violent. Well, he doesn‚Äôt punch us or hit us any way. He gets violent by punching doors or walls. There was this one time where he went up to my mum, grabbed her and slammed her head really hard against a keyboard. He said he did it just because he felt like doing it. He never displays any remorse or responsibility for his own actions. He always blames the people around him for what he does. Why would he have anger issues? TL;DR - My dad has really bad anger issues. He was raised in an abusive household, But he was the only one out of his siblings that have anger issues."

"Posted in the GayChristians subreddit: People try to use my religion to oppress my sexualityIt upsets and angers me that so-called ‚ÄòChristians‚Äô have the gall to use my religion to oppress my sexuality. I hold both the fact that I‚Äôm Christian and the fact I‚Äôm gay with the same pride and importance, and that some people think that they know what *my* god thinks about *me* makes me angry like nothing else. I live happily with my religious beliefs and my sexual orientation and those who seek to upset that balance are self serving and have no place in the Church of Christ [RELATED: 'Churches_of_Christ']."

I dont want to ever look back the the time before or during transition. Being trans has only caused me negative things and i just want to bedone with and live as a cis woman would, but thats not even going to be possible due to the boatload of transphobia, the fact that ill never be able to biologically get kids and the fact that if my future partner would realize im trans without me telling them at the beginning of our relationship theyd probably break up with me because they feel like its not okay that i dont want anything to do with being trans after transition"

"Posted in the asktransgender subreddit: What if pronouns were separate from Gender?So I‚Äôm a trans guy who uses he/him pronouns. But my parents refuse to use them bc I‚Äôm AFAB. I wish anyone could use whatever pronouns they like regardless of gender. I wish they were all gender neutral, but like, he/him were still used for those AMAB and she/her for AFAB, but you could just change em if you wanted but no one would question your gender. So a cis girl could use he/him and a cis male she/her etc, but no one would think they‚Äôre trans Not only would it allow for trans people to use their proper pronouns without outing themselves, but my parents wouldn‚Äôt have an excuse to refuse to use mine :P edit: Figured I should kinda ask a question, so what do y‚Äôall think? Would that hypothetically work or would having pronouns that are gender irrelevant make it so they‚Äôre... irrelevant? (idk how else to word that)"

"Posted in the French subreddit: PE in France?Through my local Alliance Fran√ßaise chapter, I earned a trip to France (Picardy region) for two weeks in March for a research project. Something I just thought about recently though, is the possibility of ending up taking a PE class while I'm there in whatever school I end up in. I'm not going to lie, I'm not the most fit person in the world, and I fear not being able to do the things expected of me; I'd like to fit in as well as I can while I'm there. As we are still about a month and a half from going there, I figure if I'm not prepared then I had better start now. How common is PE in 1√®me/Junior classes, and what kinds of things are expected from students in that age range physically? What kinds of exercises are most common in that kind of thing in France? I really appreciate any and all help."

Apparently you can just walk-in, do some paperwork regarding who you are and what your issues are and get set up with someone. They have licensed therapists and even a few psychiatrists on-hand, so I should hopefully be good for whatever it is I need without having go off-campus or having to use my parents' insurance. I'm trying to go next week because I've heard just in general that available appointments and timeslots can fill up pretty quickly and waitlists can get pretty long due to high demand and limited staff, so I want to get in as soon as possible. I've been watching some therapy roleplay videos just to get a hint as to what it might be like and how exactly whoever I'm assigned might handle me for the first meeting. I even tried (and pretty much completely forgot and failed to) to make a detailed list of all my symptoms and a timeline of when everything really started to hit the fan. I'm not sure if or how any official diagnosing with the school psychiatrists would work if they could even prescribe me with any meds (or how I'd be paying for those meds) but I'm still hopeful I'll get a bit closer to at least easing everything that was amplified by the last almost two years I'm not expecting a full diagnosis or anything (and definitely not an instant cure) but I just hope the CC is as helpful as people say it is and not just full of people saying ""have you tried drinking water...or drinking tea ü§î"" or ""i know you think you're useless and destined to be a cautionary tale if not completely forgotten but here's a fidget toy and a cartoon gif teaching you how to breathe üòä"" Or you know, people who would freak out when someone is dealing with something more than homesickness or regular college freshman nervousness and try to force me to go to a hospital even though I'm mostly stable Anyway, next week is a big week and I just hope everything goes smoothly but nothing more than what will happen at the CC building ü§ûüèæ"

"Posted in the ADHD subreddit: Anyone had issues with blood pressure and ADHD meds?Hi everyone, I've been on Elvanse since about September, and on my current dosage of 50mg for roughly the past three months. It's been really good mostly, other than some sleep issues, but whenever I check my blood pressure it's always crazy high. Like, between 140/80 and 150/90 when I'm sitting, it drops when I lie down. Is my heart going to explode from this or something? It's definitely because of the medication, I was usually bang-on 120/80 or slightly below before starting, I'm not overweight, I don't take other meds that cause it, etc. Thanks for any ideas!"

"Posted in the CPTSD subreddit: DAE with religious trauma find solace in new age spirituality, only to be met with the same BS in different packaging?I was raised Christian, specifically a Jehovah's Witness while being queer, nonbinary, AFAB, neurodivergent and just generally asking questions about stuff that didn't make sense to me no matter how much I was told to just accept it as Jehovah's magnificent power and will. So...yeah, you can imagine the fun mix of trauma I ended up with after dealing with that all my life. But even after all that, I still believe in a higher power, just not one that is apparently really upset that people are gay/trans and reading Harry Potter instead of oh I don't know....curing world hunger? Stopping all kinds of unspeakable things from happening to people who don't deserve it? So now I'm just building up my own spirituality and it's been really nice for the most part. Instead of being expected to follow a single text and/or leader without question forever, I'm free to explore everything and keep what I like and disregard what I don't. It's not for everyone, but for me, it's really empowering to have this much agency over everything after getting the opposite for so long. But despite everything I like, I'm still not completely free from religion related problems. Hell sometimes it's the exact same problems that pop up in all this despite all my efforts to avoid it Take manifestation, for example, most of the community is really nice and supportive of everyone, but there's this underlying attitude of toxic positivity that plagues everything. If something terrible happened to you, it's only because your own negativity drew that into your life and you won't get the life you want until to learn to simply ‚ú®love your life and yourself‚ú®. And obviously having a positive outlook on things isn't inherently bad, but unfortunately, people take it way too far. Like to the point of telling people with PTSD/CPTSD, depression, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and other mental health troubles that their life is their own fault and they need to simply learn to repress all that and replace them with elevated feelings of love and happiness or whatever. Take this one manifestation book I've been reading. It starts off with a case study that's an experience of one of the author's clients. Her husband >!killed himself!< leaving her widowed with their two young children. Obviously traumatized from this horrible event, her life starts to unravel pretty quickly. Both her mental and physical health start to deteriorate quickly she finds out her husband left her with substantial debt she didn't even know about, so she also ends up losing the house and having to move in with her boyfriend who was abusive to both her and her kids. Also and some point she got diagnosed with cancer and told she only a few months to live. And aside from the typical BS from the author about he taught her to cure her cancer and every other illness she had at this fancy seminar where no one leaves the same person, he spends the entire section talking about how her depression, anxiety, PTSD flashbacks, and grief caused all those problems. And just by mediating and thinking positively, she was able to break up with her abuser and now she's rich and healthy. That's in the very first chapter, why I kept reading beyond that I have no idea but the last straw for me was when he talks about how companies scare people into taking vaccines for diseases that aren't that bad when all they need is train their brain to not be sick. It's basically the equivalent of ""don't worry, just pray and trust God"" only you're taking the middle man out while still placing the sole responsibility and blame on the individual. And the weird part, this is a book that is highly acclaimed within the community and not a single person I've seen talk about talks about those problems with it. I like the mediation techniques but I'm not going to go through having all my problems blaming on me for not praying/manifesting enough or appeal to the wrong energies. And that's not even going into detail about all the other issues with new age communities including ableism, racism, cultural appropriation, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism, flat-out cults, and all sorts of conspiracies that are intertwined with all sorts of right-wing ideologies (think QAnon but with crystals and not *as* blatant with the white supremacy). I've even seen posts on certain forums about how the chosen 144,000 will ascend to New Earth [RELATED: 'Multiverse_(DC_Comics)'] after we're elevated to the 5th dimension, which sounded really familiar to me and then I remembered *it's the exact same thing Jehovah's Witnesses are taught will happen after Armageddon,* only the 144 [RELATED: 'Multiverse_(DC_Comics)'],000 will go to heaven not New Earth*.* It's like we're went so far from Christianity and organized religion, we've gone in a circle right back to all the same issues just with different names."

"Posted in the Asexual subreddit: I'm an Asexual Panromatic..maybe I can help with this. Often love is described as something that makes you nervous and embarrassed.. while at some point it's true, this to me is more like ""Hey..this person is pretty nice! I might like them..I'm not sure though."" Personally, I would describe love (or well, being inlove) like this: Seeing them happy makes you happy, you're comfortable around them and feel a sense of safety, you can't stand seeing them sad, they just genuinly make you happy, spending time with them is really fun (but feels different from hanging with friends.. don't know how to exactly explain).

"Posted in the MtF subreddit: Ayyyyyyyyup. After I got the diagnosis from my therapist and psych, I got the Rx for an endo. It took me two months to actually make an appointment to go see him cuz I had all kinds of second thoughts. Heck, I had second thoughts throughout that first year of transition. But I just held onto the feeling I had when I got my first IM injection, that first rush of gender euphoria was enough to give me the confidence to push through the negative thoughts. I had spent most of my life coming up with reasons NOT to transition, so it was really hard to stop those thoughts. It took a lot of therapy to work through them. The brain is like a muscle that way, if you train it to think a certain way, readjusting to a different thought process takes time."

The support of my family and some really cool teachers really helped me. One of those teachers was Mr. Lowe. In eighth grade, after our regular Language Arts teacher had a breakdown, Mr. Lowe, our new teacher, had us write about ourselves. I wrote that I didn't speak until I was three. Later on, he pulled me aside and asked if I had autism. I said that I did and he told me that his little boy also had autism. After that, he made the class more interesting for me. We did a unit on history stories and I really loved that. I did have other other cool teachers, but Lowe really stuck to me."
"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: As a pre everything trans man, what would happen if I were to die before starting any treatments? Would their be any legal problems my family would face?This has been on my head for awhile now, but after the sudden recent death of one of my grandmothers, and my current mental state, I've been really concerned and curious about how my death will, and can be legally, handled. First off, my parents are 100% accepting as well as most of my family and friends, and call me by Daniel instead of my deadname. I also live in the UK [RELATED: 'United_Kingdom'] if this affects anything legally. I've unfortunately had no luck so far with starting councilling (doctors apparently sent a request for me back in January to be mentally evaluated, but I've heard nothing back on it). My name is also still legally my deadname, though I hope to have it changed shortly after January next year. If I were to die right now, no will or anything like that, would I be legally allowed to have a tombstone with my new name on? Would my parents be allowed to have my body dressed in a traditionally masculine way? Would anything else be effected/barred by the fact that I'm not yet legally recognized as either Daniel or male? If anyone's got any insight I'd love to hear it as I'm rather concerned that I'll only be remembered as a woman, instead of the man I am."
"Posted in the bisexual subreddit: There's absolute nothing wrong with being masculine. I think a lot of men don't understand that there's a difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity. For some reason guys here toxic masculinity and think it's a personal attack on their entire identity. You can be a manly man and masculine. Masculinity only becomes toxic when you use that masculinity to control or belittle people because you're trying to feel superior. Or you feel like your masculinity entitles you to some ones attention and affection. The big problem with masculinity is that as a society we tend to define manhood in a very specific way. The way you're describing, and because of that us bi men have a hard time because the things that make us us, specifically being into other guys, is viewed as being not manly. Which sucks because there are so many ways to be a guy. Manhood is a spectrum. You can be the stereotypical guy, you can been the effeminate man. or you can be anything in between. All of us can be men. I will tell you this. I thought the same way for a long time and it's one of the reasons why I didn't figure myself out for so long and why I stayed in the closet. I got out of that mindset when I got older and realized that I was worrying about what others thought of me. I was letting them define my manhood. Once you stop playing by those rules and let yourself define your own manhood you'll be a lot happier. So, don't let people put you in a box. Define yourself. When you do that and you're being authentic then people will be attracted to that. Just be yourself. That might mean people will drift away from you, but that's OK. You don't want people who don't accept you in your life. On the flip side, don't try and define other people's manhood. You're part of the problem if you start policing other people's manhood."

"Posted in the nottheonion subreddit: In my mind, the different connotation just depends on the speaker. If my friend and I have a dynamic where we can call each other ""bitch"" in passing, chances are we'll still jump to each other's defense if someone outside our friend group calls either one of us a bitch, even if it's an accurate assessment. Tim Scott and I would most likely not be friends in real life, but as black people, I'd imagine we have had to overcome similar pre-conceived notions of how black people should move in the world. This would not be the case for Gary O'Connor. I'm not saying that O'Connor was wrong in his assessment, but it simply feels strange to me to hear a white man make that assessment."
"Posted in the writing subreddit: Short Story Cycle/Composite NovelOnly because I'm feeling pissy because I was banned from r/selfpublish for no damn reason, and I don't know. I'm in that kind of mood. But as an aspiring writer. I am black and gay and 27 years old (I'll be 28 in January, when I'm releasing/self publishing my first story) and I finished my first novel. It's a crime thriller novel about a bunch of gay and bisexual guys outcast from society from all different backgrounds that rob banks and do other organized crime. It's over 200 thousand words egad lol. I've had the idea for the story since I was in High School [RELATED: 'Secondary_school'], and it means a lot to me. I just need to work with my cover artist, do some last formatting and revising, and the bo [RELATED: 'A [RELATED: 'Sarcasm']mazon_(company)']ok is on the shelves on Amazon. Hooray! lol. My second novel (which more than likely will be the same word count link. I write what I want to write. Please choose another author if that upsets you, I really couldn't give a damn. Thank you. The story is written the way I want it written. Word count is dismissive lol.) is still going to be a contemporary thriller/dramatic prose theme. But it's a short story cycle. For those that don't know what that means, it's basically a bunch of unrelated, yet sequential short stories, but the way the short stories are told, it's technically a novel. For example, a short story book is basically a bunch of short stories and that's it. However a short story cycle or composite novel, the short stories almost like a magic trick, form this illusion of a full novel, even though it's not really, but it is. A plot example, (I'm actually stealing this idea form another guy on reddit. This idea is fantastic, but I don't think I would ever make a story out of this. It's just a demonstration and example lol) let's say there was this rich guy that died of cancer. Before he died, he gave away his favorite hat, coat, shoes, slacks, shirt, car etc. Inside each of these items was a note which explained why each of these items were sentimental and sacred to him. Random strangers he didn't know after he died, bought his items secondhand, whether they were off the internet, or at a garage sale, or thrift store, and these characters read the note and thus it's a short story. Very quickly without spoiling too much, the plot for my second story which is a short story cycle, is that a gay psychologist conducts this social experiment. He goes on reddit, and he picks nine gay and bisexual men, (from all ages. The youngest character is 22, the oldest is in his 40s, and races and personality types) and he invites him to his house for a sleepover. All ten of the guys (who are each represented in the story with a color; red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, brown, pink, white and black) confess the most thrilling and upsetting stories which have changed their lives dramatically. So that's my second story. Which I plan to publish and release very soon after my first story lol. That's pretty much the gist of what a short story cycle is. I think it's an interesting way to tell a story, and it's not done that often. Tyler Perry's, For Colored Girls (which I'm stealin [RELATED: 'Birmingham']g the color idea from lol) is one. Joy Luck Club is one. Watsons Go To Birmingham 1963 in my perspective is a short story cycle. Pulp Fiction is another short story cycle. So I wanted to know what you guys think of writing a Short Story Cycle or Composite Novel? As I don't really see it talked about much. Thank you."

My ex is Candian and I live in upstate NY [RELATED: 'Upstate_New_York'] which is only 3 hours away from the Candian border.

We were together for three years. I have tried dating apps hoping to find a local lady but nothing has stuck. I came out to myself as gay/lesbian when I turned 30 in 2017 so I consider myself to be a late bloomer. I am really scared that I am never going to find anyone and die alone despite being out for four years. I can't relate to any of the common online stereotypes of the useless lesbian because I am proactive when it comes to dating apps and have yet to find that instant and intense bond with another wlw.

All of this stuff confirms that I am gay, yet whenever I get close to coming out, thoughts flood my head like ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm not really gay?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm not right?‚Äù‚Äùmaybe this is a phase.‚Äù There are times where I feel so confident that I‚Äôm gay and want to come out so bad yet other days I get these thoughts that I mentioned above in my head. Today I took the SATs with students from all around the city. Me and my best friend decided to sign up for them a while ago. After the test, we planned to get lunch. Throughout the test, I was thinking about coming out to her during lunch the whole time. After the test, we went to lunch and I sat there with these ideas flooding to my head again. Is it normal to see this way before coming out? To be in denial or doubt? I feel like I‚Äôm ready to come out but maybe it‚Äôs a sign that I‚Äôm deep down not really ready? I don‚Äôt know."
"Posted in the AMA subreddit: Since the AIDS pandemic started more than 40 years ago just about 700k Americans died from HIV. In the two years that Covid started we have lost nearly 800k Americans. Yes, there was a much higher risk of very quickly dying. That has been significantly reduced with new medications. What makes me say that Covid is much more deadly is that it is highly infectious. Death is not in two years but within 2 weeks. I know all to well as a gay man that came out in mid 80s who has watched many friends die from that disease how absolutely devastating AIDS is. With the exceptions of children born positive or recipients of blood transfusions AIDS is preventable. I can't give you AIDS by shaking your hand, hugging you, or even kissing you."

"Posted in the polyamory subreddit: Feel Good StoryHi All, Went on our first vacation as a triad last weekend! It was fabulous. We went to Montreal [RELATED: 'Montreal'] and things went horribly wrong and we had an awesome time dealing with everything and had fun and came home feeling wonderful about the trip and our relationship(s). Months ago I decided I wan [RELATED: 'DreamHack']ted to go to DREAMhack which is a gaming convention. Because my wife (f) and I (m) have kids it was assumed I would go alone. BUT when we all sat down with our calendars and planned out our summers we realized that my partners (f) birthday was on that weekend. What if we got the grandparents to look after the kids and we all went on a trip for our partners birthday? So it was decided! We got the AirBNB booked (right downtown with a King bed) and started working on the childcare. Well the childcare was an issue, we got the majority of it sorted but then one of the caregivers got sick, like sick enough that they might not be able to do it. All of that added stress and back planning was adding up. BUT eventually we got it all covered (the night before we left)... Road trip was great, we sang songs and talked and looked out the window, made good time. THEN we got to the AIRbnb and there wasn't a king bed... there was a double... on pallets - like honest to god skids. With the stress of the kids and work and long car trip my wife immediately breaks down into tears. We all snuggle her on the double bed and let her have her time. Then we jump into action. I get on the horn to the host and start dealing with that. My partner gets on the internet to figure out the best place for dinner. Eventually I manage to negotiate a pretty decent discount with the host and it's just too expensive to move. So we improvise. Double bed on the floor, lined up with the mattress from the pull out couch and we have a giant floor frankenbed. Out we go for dinner and my partner has found the most amazing restaurant in a beautiful part of town just down the road and we share a wonderful meal and toast each other and have a really solid dig into our relationship and it's wonderful. On the way back we run across some really neat art installations and have a wonderful night in our frankenbed which totally works and we all sleep like babies. The next day my wife and I head to the game convention and my partner goes to the tattoo convention. I have a great time, but my wife is still a bit shell shocked from the night before, my partner gets two tattoos (sits for 5 hours) and feels like she's hit by a truck. Anyway it's a bit of a quiet night, my wife has a moment where she's just DONE and partner and I take care of her and she feels better, but just needs to sleep. Partner is DONE from the tattoos and just needs to sleep. So I check in and decide to go out to the gay village to check it out and party a bit. So i head to the village and it's wonderful, great experience, until i walk into a bar and the very first conversation I have is with some old gay guy who hits me with every bi phobic stereotype you can think of and then proceeds to negate my queer experience. I HATE this, it's possibly my biggest trigger. I lay into the dude calling him out on his shit, his husband eventually pulls the guy away, but I am DONE. I leave the bar and head to another. I have a good rest of the night, BUT was upset by this and drink too much and end up blacking out. I get back OK, but apparently when I get back I'm so angry I'm shaking and I tell the story and both my partners support me and listen. The next morning when I realized i'd blacked out neither of them judged me, they both just wanted to know i was OK. Sunday was wonderful, we all went to a museum and explored the city together, we stumbled on installations, street festivals, even a bicycle race. We had a nap together and then a wonderful dinner and show. Each of us ran out of gas at some point, each of us had a moment where we needed love and support. We all helped each other and we all gave and we all needed and our love survived and grew through what could've been disasters. We had an unequivocally wonderful trip. I love both my partners and I wanted to share this story with you guys."
"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: Bio tutor needing some terminology helpSo I want to start this off by saying that I don't mean to offend anyone (I know, what a great way to start a post.). I tutor intro biology and biology lab at a college and I've had quite a few questions (due to genetics section) regarding transgenderism that I don't fully know the answers to. So I'm hoping that I can get some answers from the people that (theoretically) should know the most! 1. What is the proper term for someone whom has both sets of genetalia? The term I've used is hermaphrodite, since it is a biological term and I know it comes from Hermaphroditus (totally wasn't lazy and copy pasted his name). However I've heard terms like intersex be used. 2. Are people with an extra letter in their sex DNA more likely to be trans? Like XXY ,YYX ,XYX. 3. And lastly, can trans men (FTM) that have had lower surgery, still get a period? I always say probably not , especially if the ovaries are removed. But it is safer to get an answer from somebody with more experience! I want to make sure that the trans community isn't misrepresented in my tutoring. Here is a little gift for the people that made it this far. I was once asked if gay or trans people are biological abominations ( more of an ""agree with me"" statement, and less of a question) and I simply sat there and listed off all the animals that have shown natural homosexual relationships/interactions and that there are species that can naturally change their sex, thus making humans natural and valid. The person got angry and left. I actually got an email from my boss saying that a student had sent a harsh email re my tutoring. Thankfully I didn't get in trouble (I actually was told I did the right thing). Anyway, any help is appreciated!"

"Posted in the offmychest subreddit: I ended up getting myself into a really awkward situation and need someone to discuss it.So a bit of background info. I'm 16 n I'm kinda sometimes awkward in social situations. So there's this girl (let's call her Ashley for the sake of this post) so Ashley is the only other person at my table at lunch, I also have a fire other classes with her. So I kinda knew her a tiny bit from last school year but not really. So over the course of this school year we have become friends. I'm also friends with her "" best friend"". Just as an example of what stage of friendship we're at, occasionally when like after lunch (since it'/s the last period we have together) she'lol occasionally hug me when we say like ""by see ya tomorrow"" and what not. Like she's an awesome super nice friend. So today, I figured I'd try and see if she'd wanna chill over the weekend of what not. So when we're leaving lunch I'm like ""Hey I was just wondering if you'd be down to chill outside of school, like maybe this weekend. And she's said ""Not rly"" and I was like ""Oh we still cool tho."" And she was like ""Yeah for sho"". So next period I have with her ""best friend"" who I'm also kinda friends with and she comes up to me and is like "" Hey Ashley texted me and said that you asked her to ""hang out"" "" and I'm like ""Yeah so...."" and she was like ""Well you don't have a crush on her, do you? because she texted me saying that she thinks you were tryina ask her out or something she she ain't be having any of that you hear me!"" So I was like ""Wait... Hang on.. WHAT?!? I was just trying hang out as friends like wth?!?"" I mean like she's nice and all but the idea of being more than just friends with her is honestly kinda weird to think about imo. So like yeah, what should I do to make shit less awkward like damn. Maybe she got that idea because I can Ben a bit always so like maybe I sounded like I was but still wth. What y'all suggest I do to make things less awkward? **T;Ldr** Ii'm friends with this girl. We've never hung out. I have 0 feelings for her. I ask her to hang out as just friends she says no and then next period her friend who I'm friends with says that she texted her and she thought I was asking her out (which I wasn't) and now it's hella awkward."
"Posted in the askgaybros subreddit: Rupaul's Drag Race RANT (Anti Conservatism in gay community)Now look, I support drag queens, and I support the drag art. It was one of the things that us gay men had to move forward, and to garter business, in the 1950s and 1960s and shit. I'm a gay black feminine man myself who has done drag himself. (Not professionally, but yes I have done drag and enjoy it.) I also somewhat support Rupaul. I liked his music and his albums back in the day, and him like myself, being a gay black man who grew up in a tough environment. But I just do not like Rupaul's Drag Race. I don't like how the drag culture and art, is being ruined by a dramatic, ratchet, badly edited, reality game show. I know in order for a tv show to be successful, there has to be controversy yes, but to me I don't like that shit, and if you like it great. But I was just channel surfing, and I came across Drag Race tonight. There was a challenge they were doing, they were playing Match Game, and Donald Trump came up as one of the answers to, I really hate ""BLANK"" ____. Everyone including Rupaul then all said Donald Trump, and that and they said, ""That Cheeto needs to be impeached"". My issue is, I hate how being gay, you automatically have to do, and hate certain things by default. Even though I hate identifying as one, I am a millennial liberal very much. But I would never attack anyone conservative, or anyone who supports Donald Trump. Regardless of the fact he is an asshole and racist and homophobic, still. I was just angry that I wish they would just stick to fucking drag queen related stuff, as that's what the fucking show is. I hate how everyone automatically has to have that stance. So what if I said, ""I don't support or hate Trump, but you guys that's fucked up."" so I would be eliminated off the show right? Smh. Damn. Can someone just tell me I'm not the only one bothered by that?"
"Posted in the copypasta subreddit: Ok, this is ABSOLUTE fucking bullshit. I went to take a test in class yesterday, and when I saw some sexy looking quadratics, my boner engaged. When I found the y-intercept of the equation, I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using whip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and the teacher got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on a classmate. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. He should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over him, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the teacher didn't agree with me. She KICKED ME OUT of the classroom, and I didn't even finish taking the test. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my cum after it already dried out and solidified on the carrpet. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean dried cum? You CLEAN cum after its FRESH out of your dick, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT quadratic on a test? Either make the equations less sexy, or LET ME jack off in your classroom, asshole."

"Posted in the askgaybros subreddit: Because it's true, and it's the sad part. It's why you rarely, ever, if ever never, would you ever, see any women complain about being single, or being lonely; or at least not to a severe extent. It's usually always only straight guys complaining/incel movement. Notice, there are zero women online complaining like that etc. As yes women are judged more on their looks than men are. However, she can be a 7000 pound hippo, there is going to be a guy (willing she has her standards reasonable and she doesn't mind getting with Jiminy Cricket) that would be willing to pamper her, and he will go to work, and let her watch Maury Povich, Steve Wilkins, Price is Right, Deal or No Deal, and Days of Our lives eating Bon Bons. Then when he comes home from work. All she has to do is rub his feet, and iron his pants for work the next day, and she's good. Sadly there is no gay equivalent to that. If we are even lucky to find love in the first place, as dating is so hard in this community. I know as a Gay Black fem guy, 32, single, wish I had a boyfriend. I wish I was a girl so much, and not to underwhelm trans/gender dysphoria issues, but I hate being gay, and I do not get along with most gay men, and I try to find guys to date at gay bars/clubs, and they don't like me. Maybe because I'm Black and flamboyant; and I do wish I was just a girl, and maybe I'd have a boyfriend. But OP, we are guys, and we just have to deal with the life we have. Just hope that we will find happiness and love someday. :) <3"

"Posted in the relationships subreddit: Not quite relationship advice, but adhd advice if it is what you're thinking it is. I've had adhd all my life but I've only been recently diagnosed and I've had to learn a lot of ways to manage myself better. For remembering things, have her set persistent reminders/alarms for basic things like eating, or going to bed, or to take a 5 minute break, etc. It can also be hard for someone with adhd to develop habits, so if there is a habit she is trying to get into, like going to therapy, have her set reminders and alarms for that, too. On a different note, I think she feels like she has to say yes to everything, even when she doesn't want to. Make sure she knows that she is allowed to say no to things and still be a good person. She may have quite a bit of anxiety about feeling like a good person to other people, hence feeling like a screw-up. Make sure she knows that sometimes being selfish is important and it doesn't make you a bad person. An offshoot idea that might help, might not: what if you create a mandatory family time/family dinner/family whatever at a certain time every week. Like every Saturday at 4pm or every Sunday at 7pm, whatever time works for you. If you have to have her put it in her calender, then do it, set alarms for it, remind her. This might help you and your kids bridge that connection, so to speak. Watch a movie, play games, talk about your week, etc. It doesn't matter what you do, just something together. I'm not a licensed psychologist or anything, just someone with similar mental health issues and familial issues. Hope this helps, best of luck to you!"

"Posted in the asktransgender subreddit: Androgynous/Genderqueer vs Transgender?So these past two months I‚Äôve really been questioning my gender. I‚Äôve been identifying as FtM trans online, but at least once or twice a day, I‚Äôll start to think, ‚ÄúAm I really a trans guy? Or am I just nonbinary/genderqueer?‚Äù. But I ever time I start thinking about that, it‚Äôs almost like I try to force myself to identify as FtM trans? As if I want to be a trans guy even if that‚Äôs not how I feel? Does anyone else experience those same feelings? Could it be because I‚Äôve grown up my whole life with female pronouns/being a tomboy/a masculine girl and It‚Äôll just take time to get used to changing? I think one issue I have is mentally picturing myself as a girl. Whenever I picture my face, I tend to imagine it more feminine than it really is. So identifying as a guy doesn‚Äôt seem to fit. heres a bit more background info/anything else I feel like mentioning to try and help myself figure shit out: -I‚Äôm 16, so I‚Äôve already developed -I‚Äôve always been more of a tomboy, I‚Äôve never liked makeup or boy bands, skirts, dresses, women‚Äôs clothes in general, and other traditionally ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù things. -I love mens clothes. The plaid button up shirts, suits, tuxedos, casual jeans that aren‚Äôt as focused on being fashionable/showing off ones figure, etc. -I‚Äôve always envied guys‚Äô chests, and how they can go swimming shirtless/with just a loose tshirt. -I love seeing trans guys after getting top surgery and seeing their scars become unnoticeable after a couple years because it gives me hope that I too will one day. -My biggest issue, although it‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôm least worried about, is having kids one day. I want to one say be able to announce to my husband (I‚Äôm Pan, but as of now I prefer to be (and am) in a straight relationship, so that‚Äôs how I imagine my future) that I‚Äôm pregnant, but I always think it‚Äôll be weird to be pregnant when (hopefully) passing as a guy. -Gender image? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Pan, but as of now I prefer to be (and am) in a straight relationship, so that‚Äôs how I imagine my future‚Äù When thinking of me and my boyfriend/any relationships, I always think of myself as more of a girl. It‚Äôs hard for me to consider my current relationship gay, since I‚Äôm still not sure about my gender. -Calling myself a girl doesn‚Äôt bother me. Calling myself a boy... I‚Äôm not sure. -‚ÄúIf you were given the choice to change genders, would you?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know. I honestly don‚Äôt know. On one hand, yeah I‚Äôd want to for some physical reasons (flat chest/masculine frame), but I wouldn‚Äôt want to for some social reasons (male stereotypes/gender roles etc). -A lot of my friends are girls, (due to me ‚Äúbeing one‚Äù for 16 years) and it was always nice being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. It was nice to be one of the masculine people in the group. Being a guy would change a lot of things. Obviously I‚Äôd keep my friend groups, but I guess I just don‚Äôt want myself to be grouped together with the Boys(tm) at school. -I don‚Äôt want to be some big muscular guy, and I know I don‚Äôt need to be to be a valid trans guy. but I guess thats what I picture when I think of guys, and that if I were trans and started T/got top surgery I wouldn‚Äôt be the nerdy/geeky guy. < I guess to sum this section up I‚Äôd just say, the mental image I imagine when thinking about myself as a guy isn‚Äôt accurate, but it affects my thoughts on whether or not I‚Äôm FtM trans. (I said ‚Äúguy‚Äù a lot here lol. Idk the term ‚Äúboy‚Äù seems too infantilizing, while ‚Äúman‚Äù just seems to masculine) -One reason I dont want to take T is because I like my singing voice and my range, and i dont want to mess with that, but i also feel like i might like other changes T might cause... ***If you only read one of these I‚Äôd like it to be this one bc I need to know if anyone can relate*** vvvvvvvvvvvv Lastly, these last few years of my life, I‚Äôve alway felt emotionally... empty? I‚Äôm not depressed but I‚Äôve just never really felt any strong emotions. The guy I‚Äôve liked for almost 4 years asked me out, and I felt like I was forcing myself to be happy. If I hadn‚Äôt tried to seem happy, I would‚Äôve just been like, ‚Äúsweet‚Äù when he asked me out. Or when he said he‚Äôll support me no matter what I do (in regards to what I identify as), I didn‚Äôt feel this wave of relief. I started crying, but they didn‚Äôt feel like tears of joy? It felt like I was just crying. This could have to do with my always hiding my emotions from family etc (I hate crying in front of people, or even showing signs that I was crying, and can‚Äôt show how pissed off I am when my parents start talking shit about the lgbt community) but idk. I just don‚Äôt, feel like, anything?? I can feel angry or frustrated/annoyed and stressed, but those are the only strong emotions I feel regularly. I‚Äôm either completely neutral, slightly happy/content, or pissed off and annoyed (mainly at my brother). tl:dr Im an emotional wreck with no emotions and cant tell for shit if im nonbinary/genderqueer/androgynous or FtM Trans."

"Posted in the autism subreddit: hello this is your local friendly autistic homie. please ask if things are not clear because i suck at explaining things. also if i sound aggressive, this is just how i talk. a quick run down on what autism is - it is primarily a neurological-processing disability. it comes with an increased chance of intellectual and physical disabilities. most of us will have a sensory processing disorder as well. most common of physical problems is afaik dysphraxia. doctors are not sure why autism happens. there is no cure, just ways to manage around it. note: autism is not a behavioural disorder. autistic behaviour is completely logical in accordance with our ways of processing. if you processed the way we did, you would behave the way we did. please avoid any form of ABA therapy (ABA apologists leave me alone.). autistic children grow up to autistic adults. so this depends on what you define as normal. as a parent, you should be concerned about autistic things that are inherently harmful. so, let us take non-verbal people as an example. being non-verbal is not harmful. what is harmful is not being able to communicate. so you should also be looking at alternate methods of communication, like sign language and/or AAC devices. i am NV under stress, and i appreciate my friends knowing a few basic signs so i can communicate my most basic needs. a huge part of autism will also involve you trying to understand your child. stimming communicates emotions. you can always try to stim back if it‚Äôs a positive stim. autistic children can, and do, show love. so look for ways we show love. like i sometimes intentionally seek my friends just to not talk around them. me seeking them is my show of love. some things your child will never do. accept that and move on. your child will always be autistic. things like eye contact are not necessary. also do not hide the fact your child is autistic from them. seriously. it does more harm than good. i completely forgot to answer your question but lol."
"Posted in the cfs subreddit: Body says NOIs my body finally rejecting energy drinks üòÇ lmao (Please don't respond with ""OMG ENERGY DRINKS BAD"", we all do what we can to get through the day). I tried a different drink and realized with it being mostly caffeine as opposed to jam packed with B complex (b6, b12, etc), it just gave me the shakes. So the following day I went back to another drink that I've drank before in the past and really like (no sugar, lots of b complex) I felt good for maybe a handful of hours and now my body aches and I feel like I need a coldpress for my eyes. It legit feels like red bull is the only thing I can drink now and get the intended benefit from it (sugar or no sugar version). I'm just sick of feeling like I wanna sleep 10+ hours during the day when I work in the medical legal field. I'm desperate to just about do anything to get me through the day so I can get my work done in time for the clients I work for."

At my store, courtesy clerks assist customers to their cars if they need help loading their groceries in their car. The rude customer was a grouchy old lady. Always very displeased that she had to be around the ""peasants"". Never happy with anything. She would go around in the electric scooter with a scowl. One day, I had the pleasure of helping her out to her car. She was already upset over something involving our ""order groceries online and pickup"". I didn't say anything and just walked with her to her car. While heading to her car, she asked why I, someone old enough to buy alcohol, was working here. She went on about ""women need to do something blahblahblah"". I just kept my mouth shut and nodded in agreement. Eventually, she stopped so I could reply. ""This job gets me out of the house,"" I calmly replied. ""I'm trying to get my life together."" After I loaded her groceries in and she got in her car, I simply said,""Have a good rest of your day, ma'am."" and took the scooter back inside. When I went back in, a fellow courtesy clerk was impressed that I handled the old lady. She was very horrible to him before. That happened a few months ago and she hasn't been back (to my knowledge)."

"Posted in the gay subreddit: What do you guys think I should do?Alright, so basically I believe my mom and dad are slightly homophobic. They don‚Äôt talk trash about gays in public or at home out of nowhere and stuff like that. Only when we‚Äôre watching a movie with a gay kids and they say like oh my god or wow in a non amused way. If you‚Äôve seen my posts you‚Äôve see some things they‚Äôve said to me because I believe there catching on that I‚Äôm gay. They say that my facial expressions, my hand gestures, and friends (which are girls) is kind of weird and awkward. They said I should get some guy friends. So basically, I‚Äôm assuming that when I come out, my mom and dad will be upset and confused. (they‚Äôre catholic and hispanic) anyway, last night my sister (22F) went out with her friends, and one of her friends brought her girlfriend, it was a lesbian couple. As far as I know, and I almost 99% positive my sister is straight. Last night they went out to eat since it was her friends last day at work. After eating they went out to get drinks and after many clubs, they went to a gay club. My mom said wow again in a non amused voice, like it was some kind of disgrace to be there. My sister went on to say it was so busy because it is pride weekend here in town. My mom looked confused and asked what pride was. Then she asked if it is something for the gay people. My sister said yes and then continued her story. Sooooo, I‚Äôm assuming that the reason my parents seem a little homophobic is because they don‚Äôt actually know a lot about the lgbt community. So any thoughts of this situation or what you guys think I should do? Please reply and let me know!!"

"Posted in the TransyTalk subreddit: I can only come to you in solidarity. I feel like that, too. But the thing is, I think that as trans people, we internalize the narratives made about ourselves for cis consumption, that you need to ""feel like"" x, y, z in order to join the club. So we are made to feel invalid for being momentarily at peace with our flesh prisons. That is clown shit and we don't have to take it. All this to say that you, as a bigender person, are not any less valid for feeling feminine. Now when you're feeling male, try to do some subtle things to help you feel more comfortable in your skin. Darken your eyebrows, sharpen your cheekbones with makeup, muss up your hair, just little things to make you look in the mirror and say, ""this is me!"""
"Posted in the SheffieldLake subreddit: If you are looking for a school for your kid, avoid BrooksideI have had a history of being pushed to the point of mental breakdowns. Sometimes, I'd say things without thinking. I'd make threats often but at the time I couldn't help it. Anyway, no matter how many times as a kid I'd report to staff, they wouldn't do anything. It's only when I'd do something, I'd be punished. I eventually gave up. The only time something happened, I was punched in the nose and got a nosebleed. The principle was there at the right time. Next year, the bullying got worse. Now, not only were most kids against me, but the school (proof on that later). I was heavily misunderstood. Near the last day of school, I had enough. I took out a paperclip and unwrapped it. I wrote my suicide note with the names of all the heroes to thank for my death. I wrote a few phrases in Swedish at the bottom with low-relevancy. I was caught and they ""thought it was a hit list"" and I was expelled. I know they knew it was a suicide note. It said it was on the paper. They used the Swedish phrases at the bottom as an excuse. Instead of giving me help I needed, they threw me out. I know they saw myself cutting my wrists in ISS (in-school suspension). There were cameras. They just wanted me gone because it made them look good. I was a scapegoat. Now the same kids are bullying an equally-depressed girl and I bet nobody is doing anything about it."
"Posted in the Drama subreddit: > But then you also add, and by the way please stop pointing that gun at us, it makes us uncomfortable. The point I was trying to make, is that the gun only seems to come out at times its expedient to hand wave away issues of bigotry on the part of the North [RELATED: 'Northern_United_States'], or is dismissive altogether because we dont know better for ourselves (for example Bernie Sanders [RELATED: 'Southern_United_States'] blowing off all the Southern states he lost because of 'conservative voters'). If the gun was consistently applied as a threat, that would be one thing because then it shows an actual commitment to helping, but when it only comes whenever it's expedient to people, it comes across as less of a stick and carrot, just more of a stic [RELATED: 'Southern_United_States']k. That was the crux of the argument, that for the most part, the South is given short attention by progressives who want easy symbolic victories to claim they helped create change, and then leave without helping address the long term systemic issues. They only turn their attention when it becomes a way to distract from their own issues (the tu quoque point raised in the article), or it becomes politically attractive. This sort of ""half-measure"" and ""Sunshine Activist"" can be frustrating and resentment building. You can see a lot of it in the attitudes of people who talk about ""Democrats don't deserve black/LGBT/womens votes."" So when we see these things like the boycotts and protests its easy to see them as a method comparable to ""destroying the village to save it"" and no small amount of ""we hit you because we love you"". Then when an appeal for help that extends beyond short term immediate measures with a call out of how they haven't worked before and an honest assesment of many (yes, many) Southerners of not just LGBT but racial, gender, and other minorities views that we get abandoned regularly and then stereotyped as bigots or ignorant people, recieves a reaction of ""We don't owe you nothing,"" and the rather shocking attitude of ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps and fight the bigots, cause look at how hard we worked at it"", it can sting no small ammount. >while you are getting more and more upset about what you see as people being adamant about writing the South off as a lost cause and doing nothing helpful and only harm them and cheerfully harm them as much as possible. That's what ultimately set me on edge and made me rather aggressive and angry. I can handle fair criticism (such as yours), but right out the gate when its, ""This is bullshit and this guy (girl!) is stupid!"" it can get pretty grating. It's also pretty disheartening to see these kinds of attitudes from people who are a minority who have won all of their rights with the alliance and assistance of cis and hetero people, especially an attitude of hatefulness that seems to be a way to pay back hatred they received, a sort of eye for an eye"" attitude, and tossing myself (and by extension other people who are trying to work on trying to improve the situation) under the bu [RELATED: 'Southern_United_States']s in a desire for what can only be described as revenge. Additionally the calls to just abandon the South are pretty upsetting because they seem to disregard and belittle the pe [RELATED: 'Mississippi']ople in the past who have done more than boycott a business, but actually given their lives in the pursuit of equality. Coming from Mississippi, I'm abundantly familiar with people like Medgar Evers and the 'Mississippi Burning' murders during the Civil Rights era. It seems almost alien to me that people could have an attitude almost 180 degrees from being willing to take a beating and trying to build bridges between people (Martin Luther King style), to saying ""Screw it, let it rot.""

There's a lot of different people out there and it enriches us all the more we learn about each other. Which is a very Star Trek thing to think.

If you're parents have always been supportive and accepting, and never made crude comments about anyone else on these subjects, and most importantly the relationship you have with them is healthy, then chances are everything will be fine**. And, you could always suggest to them that they do their own research. Find a couple articles or YouTube videos they could look at to better explain things and what you're going through.

"Posted in the GayMen subreddit: Heavens to Betsy! Even confident experienced middle-aged men can make fools of themselves when a pretty boy walks in the room.I got the vapours the other night. For the first time in a decade, I got flustered around a man. I was at a regular LGBT social meetup I attend. There were a few of us regulars, and there were two new people there: one mid-30s sexy man who'd been there once before, and a young man who came with him for the first time. The young man almost literally took my breath away. I couldn't concentrate around him. I couldn't think straight. I turned into a gibbering mess. As I explained to a friend-ish person who was witnessing this, I don't get fazed by attractive men. I've had sex with literally thousands of men, of all shapes & sizes, from gorgeous to not-so-gorgeous. A man is just a man to me. Until this boy walked in. Turns out he's 21. Quite pretty. Very confident. Sexually open. Intensely flirtatious. Reasonably intelligent and witty. He's practically designed to be my perfect man. Fuck! Oh, and...? I found out early during the evening that he's married to the 36-year-old man he came with. They've been married for 3 years. FUCK! I made such a fool of myself over this boy. All my instincts were telling me that he was interested in me, and I should flirt back. But I was sitting literally between him *and his husband*. He was distracting me to the point that I couldn't think straight. And circumstances were such that I couldn't just go for a walk to clear my head; I had to stay there, fumbling my way through. The boy was like my kryptonite. All my powers and abilities crumbled. I gibbered. I gabbled. I stumbled. I stuttered. I was a total mess. The last time I met a guy who distracted me this badly, I ended up in a crazy twisted beautiful damaged relationship with him for a couple of years. That was a decade ago. This doesn't happen to me very often. I'm not even sure that the boy was aware of his effect on me. I was trying so hard *not* to focus on him, while being totally unable to focus on anything else. I have no idea if he knew what was going on. Or maybe he's used to this sort of thing. The husband saw what was happening, and he was compassionate and good-humoured enough to be sympathetic to me. I think he told me at one point (the evening is a bit of a blur) that I'm not the first man this has happened to. Oh, did I mention the husband is also quite sexy, in his own way? That's a sandwich I wouldn't mind climbing into! What a mess. I hope they come back: I actually enjoyed their company, in the midst of my nervous breakdown. But I hope they don't come back: I won't cope with that a second time. I just needed to get this out of my system, to process it, and hopefully deal with it. Thanks for reading.

Usually, when people talk about the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of black women they are referring to the way in which they perceive black women coping with oppression. They ignore the reality that to be strong in the face of oppression is not the same as overcoming oppression, that endurance is not to be confused with transformation. >As far back as slavery, white people established a social hierarchy based on race and sex that ranked white men first, white women second, though sometimes equal to black men, who are ranked third, and black women last. What this means in terms of the sexual politics of rape is that if one white woman is raped by a black man, it is seen as more important, more significant than if thousands of black women are raped by one white man. Most Americans, and that includes black people, acknowledge and accept this hierarchy; they have internalized it either consciously or unconsciously. And for this reason, all through American history, black male rape of white women has attracted much more attention and is seen as much more significant than rape of black women by either white or black men. >Many black men who express the greatest hostility toward the white male power structure are often eager to gain access to that power. Their expressions of rage and anger are less a critique of the white male patriarchal social order and more a reaction against the fact that they have not been allowed full participation in the power game. >It was an accepted fact among black people that the leaders who were most revered and respected were men. Black activists defined freedom as gaining the right to participate as full citizens in American culture; they were not rejecting the value system of that culture. Consequently, they did not question the rightness of patriarchy. >White feminists so focused on the disparity between white male/white female economic status as an indication of the negative impact of sexism that they drew no attention to the fact that poor and lower-class men are as able to oppress and brutalize women as any other group of men in American society. >Sexist discrimination has prevented white women from assuming the dominant role in the perpetuation of white racial imperialism, but it has not prevented white women from absorbing, supporting, and advocating racist ideology or acting individually as racist oppressors in various spheres of American life. >All too frequently in the women‚Äôs movement it was assumed one could be free of sexist thinking by simply adopting the appropriate feminist rhetoric; it was further assumed that identifying oneself as oppressed freed one from being an oppressor. To a very grave extent such thinking prevented white feminists from understanding and overcoming their own sexist-racist attitudes toward black women. They could pay lip-service to the idea of sisterhood and solidarity between women but at the same time dismiss black women. >As I encouraged black women to become active feminists, I was told that we should not become ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs libbers‚Äù because racism was the oppressive force in our lives‚Äînot sexism. To both groups I voiced my conviction that the struggle to end racism and the struggle to end sexism were naturally intertwined, that to make them separate was to deny a basic truth of our existence, that race and sex are both immutable facets of human identity. >Contemporary black women could not join together to fight for women‚Äôs rights because we did not see ‚Äúwomanhood‚Äù as an important aspect of our identity. Racist, sexist socialization had conditioned us to devalue our femaleness and to regard race as the only relevant label of identification. In other words, we were asked to deny a part of ourselves‚Äîand we did. Consequently, when the women‚Äôs movement raised the issue of sexist oppression, we argued that sexism was insignificant in light of the harsher, more brutal reality of racism. We were afraid to acknowledge that sexism could be just as oppressive as racism. We clung to the hope that liberation from racial oppression would be all that was necessary for us to be free. We were a new generation of black women who had been taught to submit, to accept sexual inferiority, and to be silent. >Just as the 19th century conflict over black male suffrage versus woman suffrage had placed black women in a difficult position, contemporary black women felt they were asked to choose between a black movement that primarily served the interests of black male patriarchs and a women‚Äôs movement which primarily served the interests of racist white women."

"Posted in the lgbt subreddit: So I've wanted to write about this for a while.I'm pansexual, and I just wanna say that I absolutely love all bi peeps and other people whose labels are under the bi umbrella, like mine. I've been looking into LGBT+ and MOGAI's definitions of sexualities, and there's some things that I wanna talk about. First off, we all need to realize that we, as a community, are supposed to stand up for each other. There's a reason why the ""+"" is a part of LGBT+, and there's a reason why ""B"" is a part of LGBT+. Saying that bisexuality is panphobic and/or transphobic (and vice versa) is absolutely ridiculous. We, again, as a community, need to realize that ""bi"" means any person who isn't gay or straight. So, according to the LGBT+ definition, pansexuals, polysexuals, omnisexuals and others come under the bi umbrella. I'm a pan person and I fully realize it. The problem with the MOGAI way of thinking is that it forces people into labels that they probably aren't comfortable with but have to use because it's ""supposed to be them."" &#x200B; It's, in my opinion, about what label you feel comfortable with. I've liked calling myself pan. Does that mean I hate bisexual people? Abso-fucking-lutely not. &#x200B; I don't know if this was actually interesting or insightful, but please correct me if I got anything wrong. I'm not an expert about the history and origin of MOGAI whatsoever and will be more than happy to engage in conversation about it. &#x200B; Stay safe, and love to ALL peeps out there."

"Posted in the JoeRogan subreddit: I‚Äôm trans and have been living comfortably in my skin for a long time now. I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of your family, the trans community, or any human being but myself really. I‚Äôve also lived a pretty lucky life all things considered and have gotten to travel a good chunk of the globe by this point. I grew up in conservative nowhere Kansas [RELATED: 'Kansas_(band)'], travelled the country playing music for a long time, and met just about all types of people you‚Äôd think there is to meet on this rock in the ocean. In my anecdotal experience, every member of the trans community I‚Äôve met and called friend are pretty damn happy getting to live their life. All the negative feelings I‚Äôve felt and those I‚Äôve met have felt about the experience come from the social stigma of being out. It gets rough to deal with at times, not gonna lie. My decision cost me my job, my family, and pretty much my old support network as I knew it. This is what I believe to be the biggest misconception about the experience. The general public always seems to be more concerned with ‚Äúbut what if you regret it?‚Äù consciously thinking about hormones, surgeries, etc, but don‚Äôt stop to consider the things that actually cause most of the regret, like (using myself as an example) the nights where life‚Äôs got me down for any reason (rough time at work, tough situations with friends, stuff we all experience as humans) and I think to myself ‚ÄúI sure wish I could pick up the phone and talk to my dad, I could really use one right now.‚Äù Those are the times where I ask myself ‚Äúwas all of this really worth it? Being alone in this world?‚Äù And you know what? I meditate on it for a bit and always come back to a resounding ‚Äúyes, absolutely.‚Äù The alternative for me would mean being shoved back into a scary closet and living a lie of a life full of shame and soul crushing depression. Again, I can‚Äôt speak to your experience with your own family and trust your judgement. My only kind observation is that you‚Äôll notice the underlying tone in your comment that being trans is a choice, that one day I wake up and chose decaf, Sunnyside up eggs this time around, and hell im gonna pump my body with hormones just cause. I‚Äôve lived my whole life knowing this was something fundamentally wired into my brain before I even stumbled across the word ‚Äútrans‚Äù for the first time. If you take a look at human history, there‚Äôs many cultures around the world that have had their variants of and reverence for ‚Äúthe third gender.‚Äù It‚Äôs been a thing just as long as heterosexuality and homosexuality have been a thing. What hasn‚Äôt always been a thing is the ability to walk outside with a relative level of safety and security knowing you won‚Äôt get the living shit beat out of you, though it worries me we collectively seem to be headed back in that direction. It‚Äôs happened to me a few times within the last 4 months and literally never any other time in my journey. It‚Äôs only because it‚Äôs the new buzzword and new moral panic that‚Äôs been drummed up this year. Again, just my opinion on that. At the end of the day, trans people are just that: people. You, me, everyone in this thread (minus the bots I suppose). Some of the kindest and greatest humans I‚Äôve looked up to in my life are die-hard trump supporters. Their love and support of me had nothing to do with politics. When I came out, some of those very people reached out to say ‚Äúhey man, I don‚Äôt really understand this all that much but I‚Äôm a Paperplayte fan 100%, and I‚Äôve got a bunch of old clothes I don‚Äôt wear anymore. Want em?‚Äù I see it as we‚Äôre all humans sucked into this culture war and tricked into fighting each other when I want to wake up to my shitty fucking day, go to my shitty fucking job, get off work and have some shitty fucking beers with my shitty fucking friends like the rest of us. It‚Äôs all deflection to keep us distracted from this broken political system and economy we are ALL suffering from, and they know there‚Äôs power to be had when we all band together behind that sentiment which is why they don‚Äôt want it. So instead we get ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk about trans kids! More at 11.‚Äù Id rather spend time getting along with my neighbors and contributing to the community we all share. There are more important things for us all to be worrying about right now. Should there be nuanced discussion about trans policies? Yeah absolutely, bring it. I simply think at the collective level, we‚Äôve got bigger fish to fry at the moment. I never really comment online about anything trans related or really anything political for that matter. Idk what about your comment prompted me to make this exception, consider yourself lucky :) to me, your comment reads as someone who loves and cares deeply about their family. I could be wrong, tho I hope not, because at the end of the day that‚Äôs what it should be about regardless of what‚Äôs between the legs, and I really appreciate seeing that and hope we as a society can come back to that same loving place for our neighbor. I also just got off a 12 hour day at work and I‚Äôm fucking exhausted...sorry for this long winded disjointed rant. I‚Äôm gonna kick back and wind down listening to some JRE (avid listener for about 10 years and probably one of the only transwomen you‚Äôll meet who does her makeup to the sounds of Joe Rogan and Duncan Trussell before heading out for the night :) ). I hope all is well in your world."
"Posted in the KitchenConfidential subreddit: Genuine question on counter service vs. table service for those who know the biz bestSo I live in a larger US [RELATED: 'United_States'] city where there's a growing trend of restaurants switching to counter service only. Yesterday, my fiance and I went out to grab some dinner at a highly recommended taco joint. We walk in the restaurant into a standing area about the size of a shoebox with no clear direction on how/where to order. We did our best to exercise common sense and stand out of the way, only for a worker to come up to us and passively say ""I think the line starts over there"" on the other side of the shoebox. Okay, whatever. I did my time in the kitchen years ago and know that I don't wanna fuck with their flow, just get in and out as fast as possible. Get the food, sit down, smash. Meanwhile, a woman walks in and sits at the table behind us. I hear the conversation as follows: Server: ""Sorry ma'am, you can only take a table after you order at the counter."" Customer: ""Oh, I'm sorry, you don't have any signs up front. Can I at least get a menu from you?"" Server: ""You can find them by the register"" Customer: ""I see. Can I least get a glass of water while I wait?"" Server: ""There's a self serve station right over there."" The lady just shakes her head and walks out of the building. The point of this post has less to do with that lady/specific restaurant and more the principle as a whole. Can someone explain to me the pros/cons of counter service vs. table service and why a lot of businesses seem to be switching to this model? I've had some people give me some vague arguments before that make sense on paper, but just about every time we go out to eat at a place with counter service it's poorly organized/executed and ends up coming off as, well, lazy. Going out to eat is a rare opportunity for me to go out and pretend like my life isn't dog shit, and having table service/a friendly voice to talk to adds to the overall experience for me. I hate feeling like I just burdened a worker with my audacious question of ""can I get a glass of water"" to just watch them roll their eyes and point to a self-serve station I wasn't aware was even there. &#x200B; For those working for establishments with the counter service model, I'd genuinely like to hear your input on some pros/cons through your experience."

It definitely looks better, but there are still very noticeable, very not-accidental looking scars on my forearm So I'm going to do it I think, I'm going to do the mature, adult thing and tell them the truth\* ^(\*by which I mean I'm going to tell them about my arm and how it was an isolated incident that happened all the way back in December. Not about the continuous yeeting that happened on my thigh on-and-off up until a few weeks ago because I can still hide those pretty easily because modesty and not knowing how to swim or anything.) It's not even the worse thing I can tell my conservative ""oh my god, lil nas x is trying to corrupt the children"" parents. There's a whole list of worse things: * coming out as bisexual * I'm starting to think my gender wanders outside of just ""woman"" * I bought two vibrators + lube a few weeks back * I've had a secret gmail since I was 11 that I've used to sign up for social media stuff like this behind their backs ever since * that I'm pretty sure my childhood and early adolescence was fucked up enough to give me CPTSD * I bought four pacifiers because age regression seems like a much healthier coping mechanism then beating myself into a pulp every time bad feelings happen IT WILL BE FINE I'M SURE Plus I'm 18, they can't force me into hospitalization and I (mostly) doubt any reasonable hospital would put me on a hold for old scars since I managed to talk myself off the ledge of final yeet because for a whole bunch of reasons I'll still have to deal with the prospect of them freaking out and assuming I must be suicidal or psychotic or something, maybe they'll try to take my door off or search my room (which would be infinitely bad because all the other aforementioned secrets), but I think that's just me coming up with the worst case scenarios I'll even tell them about how I have a plan to get long-term help for my issues (which for the sake of simplifying it for them, just all the stress of Zoom college and the pandemic, none it their fault at all) for completely free/super cheat via my college counseling center once it reopens in the fall.

"Posted in the trans subreddit: Some of these can be depersonalization-derealization symptoms, it's a kind of dissociation that some trans people have before they transition and it can take the form of not being able to envision or care about a future for yourself. It can feel like a lack of purpose or meaning, as in you can consider these things but you don't feel them resonate for you or motivate you at all - it just doesn't feel like there's any reason to care. Yes, this can be one of the ways that dysphoria expresses itself, and I wasn't aware that this was part of my dysphoria until I started transitioning and felt it going away for the first time. I didn't know transitioning would also come with being able to care about the world and myself, but for me it did."

"Posted in the SecularJewish subreddit: > Does anyone attend services but is still secular? My schul is closer to Reconstructionism than anything else, so having a complicated relationship with the idea of divinity is pretty much expected. And, in line with that, engaging with ritual as cultural expression is an entirely expected way of engaging. Also, and FWIW, I, personally, avoid calling myself things like ‚Äòsecular‚Äô or ‚Äòreligious‚Äô. Both terms are so thoroughly colonised by Xtianity that they can‚Äôt be usefully applied to other cultural and religious traditions. I keep kosher, observe Shabbat, go to shul regularly, study the Talmud, and can be clocked as Jewish by my presentation. OTOH, if we take hegemonic Xtianity‚Äôs ideas of divinity as given, I‚Äôm an atheist. I do all these theoretically religious things because they are parts of a cultural traditions that I value highly. Calling me either religious or secular doesn‚Äôt work because the words really mean ‚Äòreligiously Christian‚Äô and ‚Äòculturally Christian‚Äô respectively. Even calling myself an atheist is a bad-fit. It‚Äôs more correct to say I‚Äôm an atheist for normative values of the word *G_d* (and normative values of that word are, in English at least, entirely Church-centric). But the idea of divinity, and engaging rigorously with that idea as part of the Talmudic dialectic and the ethical structures that emerge from said dialectic, is, to me, an incredibly useful thing. It‚Äôs less that I do or don‚Äôt believe in G_d and more that using divinity as a focussing point and arguing tool is way too fruitful and useful to not keep doing so.

Though nonetheless, I trust you are well familiar with the prevalence of these kinds of views. > The leadership position isn't that homosexual people should be tortured or killed. It is one thing to disagree with a homosexual lifestyle on theological/moral grounds, and quite another thing to call for their persecution or death. Would that ""persecution"" include imprisonment? Because the statement I quoted, signed by your primate, said, ""We are also acutely aware of the ongoing violence against Christians in Northern Nigeria ‚Ä¶ **We are equally concerned for** the affected communities in Chile from the recent earthquake, terrorist attacks in Kenya, and **the backlash from the international community in Uganda from their new legislation**."" That was the proposed legislation that provided for the mass murder of gay people before it was amended to only imprisoning them for life. (Of course, the statement has since been taken off the website.) > Look, I'm pretty sure you know the OP, so you would also understand how he would interpret what I wrote.

"Posted in the AmItheAsshole subreddit: NTA. As a trans nonbinary person 90% of the time asking for preferred pronouns is the right way to go about things if you're not sure, it shouldn't be a rude question and should be something we normalise more. It's not even massively personal, it's just the polite way to figure out what someone wants to be called. In cases like this where you already know the person, it might be better to say ""oh have I been getting your pronouns right?"" &#x200B; Edited because of updated info!"

"Posted in the truscum subreddit: OK, I can see that, That is valid, I do think that some seperation is a key to peace. for example, I'm Ace, and I feel really bad when Allo (non ace) talk over me *(like, there was a famous LGBT allo youtuber that joked about how ""asexuals are NEVER beaten up for being asexuals!!!"" and ""It's something (mentally ill) in their brain"" And,* *I was beaten up* *for being ace, also I was thought I had a mental illness when I found out I was ace and thought I could cure myself, which was a horrible experience, and I can understand how painful it feels when someone, who isn't your community, talks over you)* I do honestly believe there is a need in separation in terms of not only the enby and binary trans people, but maybe to even extend it to the entire community. for example, I honestly don't believe you, as trans, can talk over aces, just like I, as Ace, can't talk over trans people, Or like someone else, who is Lesbian, shouldn't talk over Bi people like me, and I, as Bi, can't talk over lesbians, if that make sense. but to an extent. like, it really depends on how far you go with it, when I talk about it, I mean big things like media coverage, not silly things, I will now give an example to, what I see as a silly thing: I met a exclu with that ""idea"" IDK, ""vendata""? they weren't a really sane person (IDK if they were a truscum or tucute. personally I also don't care, I'm neutral). and they were seriously hating asexuals (and I mean hating, not just the ""asexuals are not LGBT+"" usual silly stuff, but more of ""Asexuals prey on young gay kids and hurt them in order to force them to deny their natural born desire"" kind of crazy) and they were Really mad about an asexual (or gray asexual? don't remember) that become a mod in their enby subreddit (volunteer of course) and they were saying that they someone ""talked all over them"" as enby and I was like ""WHAT?"" The ace guy is a volunteer, not a representative of enby and he never claimed to be an enby or trans. he came to help the sub. They (the enby)... I'm mentally kinda ill and I honestly say that... I think they were far more worse so I know they aren't a good example, but what do you think about this situation, was they in the right? (They use They/them) I think not because the grey a never spoke over any enby, he came as a volunteer to help them mod the sub and I think it was ungrateful to give shit to someone who came to help (unless of course the were transphobic, which, at least according the the enby, the Ace guy was only transphobe cause he ""stole the place of enbies in mod team"" as... a volunteer???) what do you think on the issue?"

Double check with your carrier though to make sure there won‚Äôt be issues. Some insurance carriers have started adding gender affirmation benefits to their plans like Sun Life, Green Shield, Equitable Life and Beneva but, for the most part, the employer has to opt in and not every employer does; however, there are a number of employers who have like TD, CIBC, Government of Canada and even the United Church.

Real context: My only concerns are that on the left side, my scars are neat (light colored, not raised) while the right is less aesthetically pleasing (redder, thicker, raised, chunky). The right side also has a bit more tissue in it currently which is likely just me having gained weight. Also on the right, the nipple has been giving me some random stinging pain that the left doesn‚Äôt. I massage both sides equally and regularly (at least twice a day) and I apply a scar liquid (Bio Oil Skincare Oil third pic) morning and night with the massage. What could be causing the difference in scar tissue and nipple pain? This is more on the left side and unimportant to me, but I have some tissue/scaring that sticks out somewhat. It doesn‚Äôt look like real dog tags but that‚Äôs what my mom has been calling them. She says I should get them removed but I honestly don‚Äôt care about that enough to go under again.

For many of them, professors seem imposing and unforgiving figures, so much so that many students are afraid to ask for something as simple as an extension on a deadline for fear of appearing vulnerable and weak. Your point about not asking students questions at random is well taken. I rarely do that. I much prefer the think/pair/share method of generating class discussion. In other words, I generally ask students to think about a question, share their answer with their neighbors, and then invite an open class discussion in which people volunteer answers. This usually generates great conversations, giving everyone a chance to participate by talking in pairs even if they're uncomfortable talking to the group as a whole. Again, thank you for your kind words and wishes!"

"Posted in the shiftingrealities subreddit: I've had a very harsh view of homeschooling since my mom had me go to school online as a way to isolate me from my peers (as instructed by her religious beliefs) so I would never get to socialize with kids my age and I'm completely inept at socializing because of it. But as I learn more about it, the more I think I would homeschool my kids too at least if I had any in this reality. Private school is expensive and public schools are complete garbage. They're literally designed to train kids to conform and get used to dedicating several hours of their day blindly following someone's orders without question so they'll be ready to work when they grow older. They get put in boxes where they're either a good student or a bad student with zero consideration of their own interests and strengths. And don't even get me started if you're in any way disabled, queer, or a person of color. I learned way more reading books for personal enjoyment and watching YouTube videos than I ever did at school. So much of what is taught in school is heavily sanitized to decide how we view the world or is completely ignored because society has decided that it's not a ""useful"" skill or interest to have. Not to mention I'm in the US [RELATED: 'United_States'] where you can't trust that your children will be safe due to you-know-whats. They have to hold (tw)>!shooter drills to teach kids how to improve their survival chances!< alongside fire drills now, that is not an environment I would want my child to be in, ever. Socialization with kids their age is very important, but like you said, there are plenty of ways to make sure those needs are met outside of the school system. I admire your choice to homeschool and I think your future children will be very lucky to have you as a parent :)"

"Posted in the AskABrit subreddit: American here, is healthcare really free? Do the doctors care about helping people if they aren‚Äôt getting paid by the people?So I assume that if doctors aren‚Äôt paid by their patients then the government pays them. If the government pays them no matter what, why would they work hard to satisfy their patients? If a patient comes in and is super satisfied with your work, they will do more stuff with you and give you more money bc they come back. This would motivate doctors to help patients feel satisfied (even if they are taking advantage of them). But if the doctors aren‚Äôt paid by the people, would they work near as hard to give a patient the feeling of satisfaction? Sorry if this is like a super closed minded view or something, I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone can explain.

"Posted in the polyamory subreddit: Question about cohabitation and legal jamsHey All, I'm looking for examples of contracts or written agreements for triads or groups co-habitating. Bit of background. My wife and I own a home in Canada [RELATED: 'Canada'] and have a couple kids. We've both been seeing our girlfriend for several months as a triad and seeing her for a couple years before that as more of a close FWB. There is potential a few years down the road to live together as a big happy poly family. My question is around legal protection for her as our partner if we all choose to go that route one day. As common-law and marriage law doesn't cover additional partners how best do we help her protect herself in the unlikely event of a messy break-up. My wife and I are married, kids are ours, house is ours and each of us has all kinds of layers of legal protection in this situation. My thought experiment led to something akin to a letter of agreement that gets notarized that would cover somethings like financial responsibilities (does she pay rent? do we indicate who maintains the house?) who owns what if we break-up or make household purchases together? If we do break up how long should she stay living with us? Also furthering the thought experiment. If we decide to ""get married"" insofar as possible. Would a document with a family lawyer along the lines of a pre-nup be sufficient or even protect her in a court? If we decide to co-parent is there a way to give her some parental rights short of divorce and remarriage? If this gets closer to reality we'll post in the legal subreddits. But I was having lovely dreams about a life together and I want to do what I can to balance the couple privilege a bit and make sure that she has what she needs to feel safe with us should we get there. Any thoughts, experiences or even sample documents would be wonderful to hear. I know it's all horribly unromantic but some idea of what you guys do about this stuff might help keep the romanticism in the dream. edit: DM's are ok if you dont want to be public with this stuff."

"Posted in the Anxiety subreddit: I can't fight something IDK exists. (when you can't feel anxiety mentally, but just physically)So, I'm confused, to say the least. I was diagnosed with anxiety 3 weeks ago, I don't think it sank in, or maybe it did and my brain wasn't able to process it.. or maybe it did process but know all along, so my brain just went ""Oh No!.- anyways-"" My anxiety is.. a bit weird? like a lot of times I feel nothing no stress (maybe some tight muscles) but mentally I'm usually not really ""feeling"" anxious unless its really bad (than I can literally freeze in time 1/10 would not recommend, especially not for an hour long like it was in my first uni test. was not fun as you can imagine) but it manifests itself.. in a more dangerous way(?). I always had problems with my stomach, since 4th grade, like literally, I'm in the bathroom a lot, my stomach might be a bit bad when it comes to gluten (but not gluten intolerant) and I have Irritable bowel syndrome, and something a bit rare (1 to 1,000,000 births) a birth defect called ""wondering spleen"" where my spleen kind of ""crushes"" my stomach (0/10 would not recommend either), that's where my anxiety takes over, and oh fuck it fucking does. any minor inconvenience? running to the bathroom. someone mentions sickness/bulling/the holocausts/r\*pe or anything at all? running to the bathroom. me thinking of posting something (like right now)? running to the bathroom. the worst thing is that you can't fight something you feel only in your stomach and not even mentally aware (unless it's extremes, and when it's the extremes I'm already fucked and not in reality anymore) &#x200B; I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with my stomach. I give up perusing a physics degree because it was just so bad, I stated hating the subject I used to love, because how can I love this when all I feel looking at physics now is literal physical pain? The funniest part is, I'm a master of disguise from a young age (again-1/10 would not recommend becoming one yourself) so people can literally look at me pleasantly smiling when inside my head the tiny people are burning my fucking system while screaming ""where is the eject bottom from this reality?"" so even my family is in complete shook that I have severe anxiety and people obviously would also be like WHAT BUT YOU ARE SO CALM ALL THE TIME?"" but the biggest problem... is my weight. Now I don't have any sort of anorexia or anything like that, I love food, I loooooooooooooove food, every food, just give me food all day and night long I'll eat-but- nothing stays in my body. I'm struggling to keep myself only on that ""precious"" silver lining between normal weight and underweight, I'm 47-50 Kg (50 on a good day, 23 yo, 1.66 M I think) and fighting hard not to fall into the ""bad area"" of weight , all my little sister in normal weight are above me in kg, but no matter how hard I try or stuff myself I'm going to find myself barely on the silver line and going down. I used to be 56 before Uni, I'm 47 now and going slowly thinner, IDK what to do, people in my family started pointing out ""WHAT TF HAPPPEND WHY ARE YOU SO THIN?"" and IDK what to say anymore. &#x200B; That's all I just wanted to vent a bit IDK what's wrong with my systems. and yea, I'm on med for anxiety, and I did had a meetings and a lot of checks for my stomach (which was SHIT. CT [RELATED: 'CT_scan'] is the fucking WORST, and so many blood tests made my head go into the fucking spirit realm) But IDK, I'm just grumpy from how everything turned upside down, I always felt good for my grads and now when it's gone...

Hospital protocol is that the employee is supposed to meet the driver downstairs while the driver sit out side in their car. We‚Äôre not allowed to bring the food in and leave it at The front desk/visitor information center. Considering this hospital is actually a teaching hospital with the University and split up into five parts, I wanted to make sure I can get the food to the right location, fast and efficiently so I texted ahead of time. No answer five minutes later I arrive at the main entrance of the main hospital. I tried calling the cell phone. No answer left a message. Waited another 10 minutes. Decided to go inside to see if I could get some help. Since I didn‚Äôt have a last name, they really couldn‚Äôt help me out. I waited close to half an hour after three text unanswered and three calls with messages. I finally get in touch with DoorDash support. Next thing I know the order is canceled, her money is refunded, I get to keep the food and I get the tip. It was annoying especially since I ended up going over the time I scheduled myself till because I had other things to do. But it was still a win. Just annoying how customers have no regard for wasting your time which cuts into making money especially when you try to be professional."

That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and the teacher got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on a classmate. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. He should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over him, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the teacher didn't agree with me. She KICKED ME OUT of the classroom, and I didn't even finish taking the test. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my cum after it already dried out and solidified on the carrpet. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean dried cum? You CLEAN cum after its FRESH out of your dick, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT quadratic on a test? Either make the equations less sexy, or LET ME jack off in your classroom, asshole."

"Posted in the Frugal subreddit: I need feedback on my Cell Phone options.So, here is the situation I am at. I looking at cell phone options, while also looking at finances, both short term and long term. Here is the overall situation. My credit is absolutely terrible, and I am in the beginnings of rebuilding it. One good option for me of course is a cell phone plan. Now, currently my credit is so atrocious that I can't get a regular plan with any of the major carriers except T-Mobile with their FlexPay plan. Essentially it is a pre-paid account that if you pay on time for 6 months you can switch to a normal cell phone plan that does report to the credit bureaus. Now, I do need a smart phone for work (I'm in IT and need normal access to the internet and applications away from a computer). Yes, I can get an Android through Virgin Mobile with a much cheaper plan than what I would get through T-Mobile, however I would be paying much more up front for the phone on essentially a pre-paid phone with no credit reporting. So this is where I need feedback. Do I go with T-Mobile, get a cheaper Android phone than I would with Virgin but with a higher service charge each month., and work my way to a reporting credit line, or do I look at other options for credit enhancement, via the more expensive Virgin phone with the cheaper plan ?"

"Posted in the LGBTeens subreddit: [Family/Friends] My dads thoughts on homosexualityI am a 17 year old closeted gay with Hispanic Catholic parents. Now, my parents have never given me a reason to believe that are homophobic, like ever. But they also haven‚Äôt even said anything supportive letting me know that it‚Äôs ok to be gay. Last years I‚Äôve gotten mixed signals from my parents. If you have ever seen any of my posts or take a quick glimpse at my past posts, they have said stuff that give me a taste of hope but also things that made me question that. I‚Äôve always wanted to see if there was a way to find out what they really think of homosexuality. And today may have finally been that day. Today was my first day of senior year. I am taking AP Government and for the first day, teacher gave us a website to take a quiz on what our political ideology is. It asks you to choose the idea you most closely agree to obviously about political beliefs and one of the options was ‚Äúhomosexuality should be accepted by Society‚Äù and the other was ‚Äúhomosexuality should not be accepted by society.‚Äù Obviously being gay myself I picked the first option. However, when I looked to my right i saw the student next to me click the second option. It sucked to see and it was such a wake up call knowing that some people will always not like people like us. I also go to a Catholic high school so I know the teachings are more conservative but when I do come out I‚Äôm planning on being unapologetically myself because I‚Äôm not letting anyone tell me what they like or don‚Äôt like about me anymore. Anyway, the day went on and as I was driving home from work at night I came up with a brilliant idea. I decided to say that the teacher made it extra credit to see if we have the same political ideology as our parents. Anyway at the end of the quiz, it shows how you answered all the questions and when he gave me back the computer i was honestly so nervous to see what he said and as I scrolled down, I saw that he put ‚Äúhomosexuality should be accepted by society.‚Äù Now, i don‚Äôt know what this means but it has to be good, right? The only flaw i see there is if he is fine with other people being gay, as long as it isn‚Äôt his own son. But honestly I don‚Äôt care because I finally found out what I needed to know. This makes me so happy. I still feel like he is uncomfortable with it because he fast forwards scenes where gay couples make out but at least he watches shows and movies with representation and doesn‚Äôt comment on it. I feel like when I do come out he‚Äôll either not like it because I‚Äôm his son or it will help him feel more comfortable with homosexuality since he‚Äôs never actually been used to it growing up. Now I just need advice on what to do. My New Years resolution was to come out this year to attract one person if not everyone. I finally think that that time is coming closer and closer and I can‚Äôt be more happy."

"Posted in the AskReddit subreddit: **TL/DR: While at a sleepover, I overheard the host's parents getting a divorce. Host later on bawls her eyes out in 11th grade while reading a poem about her dad.** **Main characters**: Me, Sleepover Host (SH), Host's mom (Kathy), and Host's dad (Craig). **Side characters**: 11 other sleepover attendees. **Setting**: 2013 at SH's house. We had been invited over to have a sleepover to celebrate the end of sixth grade. **Story**: After doing the typical girl sleepover stuff (Makeovers, gossiping about classmates that weren't invited, boys, etc), we had pizza and soda for dinner before moving our sleeping bags to the living room. The other girls fell asleep, but I was still awake. At some point, SH's parents came in to check on us. I pretended to be asleep by closing my eyes. When I heard them move into the kitchen, I kept my eyes closed because you could see into the living room from the kitchen. SH's parents talked for a bit before it got quiet. Then suddenly, from the voice of SH's mom, came the words: **""Craig, I want a divorce.""** This freaked me out because I knew that divorces were hard on everyone, even if it was the best thing to do. I had no experience with divorces personally, but I had read a few stories where the parents are separated. Craig: What the fuck do you mean you want a divorce? Becky, we have five kids! Becky: Maybe if you had a better job, then I wouldn't be wanting a divorce! They argued about it, but that didn't wake up SH or any of the other girls. I laid there pretending to be asleep, feeling very awkward listening to a marriage falling apart. It felt very tense the next day. Four and a half years later, now in 11th grade, we were writing poems in our English class. SH got up to present hers. It was about her dad. Apparently, after the sleepover, Craig had done some fucked up shit before walking out on Becky and the kids. SH said that she now hated his guts. Then she started bawling, but she kept reading her poem."

She‚Äôd let me play with whatever, and wear whatever and so on. But being raised as a girl in a catholic home, I‚Äôm inevitably going to have feminine things forced on me. Like wearing dresses to church on holidays or whatever. and as I grew up I became more and more masc. I realized I prefer masculinity over femininity 90% of the time. But ofc I didn‚Äôt know what being trans was. It‚Äôs not like my conservative parents are going to tell me that the term ‚Äútransgender‚Äù exists. They weren‚Äôt going to tell me I could be anyone but their daughter.

But I seem to have gotten a bit off track. Basically does anyone have any rebuttals for my mothers argument that because I was willingly fem as a young child I can‚Äôt be male now?"

"Posted in the adhdwomen subreddit: Understimulated/ analyzing showsHey everyone, my SO and I watch TV together most nights. We watch it separately at the moment as we live apart, but I find myself struggling to stay interested, even with new stuff we‚Äôre watching. I have Autism and ADHD (inattentive). Lately, I‚Äôve been sketching or drawing things while watching a show or movie, which doesn‚Äôt always help when we want to discuss it later, but this has been my go-to for a while to stay engaged. I also struggle with something else, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to neurodivergence. I often find myself not connecting to characters or I try to predict what‚Äôs going to happen next, and if I‚Äôm correct, it kinda makes me disinterested. I think this is also a vulnerability thing, where I am maybe not wanting to be emotionally invested, so I try to analyze it? Other times, my SO will ask me for my thoughts on the show, and I will have literally zero, which is okay but we like to discuss it together, and sometimes I struggle with just enjoying it. IDK, but I‚Äôm interested if anyone else has done this."

Im getting my degree, it‚Äôs my first, and family and friends will be there. I‚Äôll even invite his family too. I keep thinking about how romantic and sweet it would be for him to surprise me and attend the ceremony, what a brief reunion would look like, the affection, the crying, maybe looking out into the crowd and seeing him and realizing he was there. It‚Äôs all a fantasy I guess, I cry telling myself it won‚Äôt happen, and as I update him on the date, time, and how I‚Äôm preparing, he says he‚Äôs sorry that he won‚Äôt be able to be there. I know he‚Äôs really sad he won‚Äôt be here for such a big milestone for me, and I wish I could share it with him, even if I just saw him for a moment, a glance, a hug, a kiss. I can‚Äôt keep thinking about it because I know it will give me false hope, but it‚Äôs been on my mind for weeks, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do because I know I‚Äôll realistically go through the ceremony and I won‚Äôt be able to celebrate with him then and I won‚Äôt see him, but I can‚Äôt help but hold hope and pray that a miracle will happen. I might be fucking crazy, it‚Äôs only been a couple months, but I don‚Äôt know how to handle this?

"Posted in the MomForAMinute subreddit: Hey Mom, I've been struggling a lot the past few months and I'm finally getting help tomorrowMy mental health was already kinda shaky before the pandemic but afterwards (especially December 2020 and early this year) it really just hit rock bottom. For the most part, I've still been functional (just barely) but since college started back with in-person classes I think it's just making things worse We've only been back for a little more than a week and I'm already feeling super overwhelmed with my classes (which probably isn't helped by the fact that I'm a CompSci major, super demanding and unforgiving) Thankfully I already took the initiative of heading to my school's counseling center last week and starting the process so conveniently as things were getting bad today, I got an email reminding me of the appointment along with the link to the forms I need to fill out in preparation for tomorrow. Forms that I managed to fill out after I struggled my way through my Calc homework and couldn't get the access code for my Physics class module to work (and then I cried :D) It's going to be limited sessions with a doctoral student (supervised by one of the heads of the psych program) but it's free, confidential, and (outside of an emergency contact only to be used in crisis) completely away from my parents who have honestly been no help whatsoever, and especially with my actual mother have only contributed to my poor mental health. Plus I'm also supposed to be meeting with one of the peer advisors of one of the STEM programs I'm a part of. They're mostly chill short, chill meetings where our peer advisor gets to know us better, but instead of just saying that I'm fine and everything's fine, this time I was considering letting them know that I'm having issues (I won't get super detailed, but I'll just let them know I've been having a hard time adjusting and overall just haven't been feeling 100%) It is a part of their job to some extent to act as part of a larger support system for the students who are assigned to them, so idk, maybe it's a good idea of I don't end up wimping out and hiding behind ""oh I'm fine"" like usual. But fr, tomorrow I'm doing a lot more asking for help and being honest (well *slightly* more honest) than I've done in the past year and I'm kinda stressed I can't talk to my actual mom about it because all I'll get for my troubles is ""it's that phone or those books (even though I've barely read an actual traditional book in months), you'd feel better if you just breathed and read the Bible. She doesn't even know about what I'm doing with the counseling center (when I asked for therapy, i was told it was a waste of time and money, plus i shouldn't be blabbing about my feelings in a ""professional environment"") I'm starting the process of building a support system and getting some help, and ironically I'm doing it all alone with zero assistance from the people who are supposed to be my main support system (they didn't get the memo that parenting is more than just feeding your kids and not beating them) It's just...it's a lot...you know üòÖ"

This kind of territory is new to a lot of people and it doesn't always have the same societal conventions as normal conversations sometimes. I would explain it to her in the absolute simplest form possible. ""I hate my body. I don't want this body. It causes me physical and mental pain. You used to know me as a woman. I am a man. For the rest of my life I will be a man. I am not a woman. I am not your sister. I am your brother. Every time you talk about how I used to be, it causes me pain and I need you to stop talking about it. I am not that person anymore. I have grown. If you can't accept this, I can give you space. This is who I am. This is not new. This is who I have always wanted to be.""

I want to be seen as the same way I feel I already am."" Does this help?"
"Posted in the ftm subreddit: People who have decided not to medically transition, I need advice (or comradery)I'm prefacing this by saying that I fight for everyone's ability to medically transition (and legally but that's not what this is about) . I believe it should be accessible without a doctor's permission like any other cosmetic surgery. I cheer when I hear of someone getting one of their surgeries or starting hormones. That will not change and is not what I am talking about specifically. I'm getting this out there now so there is no question that the only one I am holding to this standard is myself. For some reason whenever I consider getting top surgery, or a real binder, or going on t, it feels like I'm cheating. Like I should put more effort into loving every aspect of the body my mind has been put in without medical intervention. I feel like I am successful at being okay with myself and I do decently at loving myself, but there's that nagging voice in the back of my mind that tells me how much easier it would be if I used these resources I feel everyone should be able to use. I'm almost 20 now and I've made a deal with myself not to transition medically until I'm 24, but before then, I was hoping to hear from people who decided not to medically transition and your reasons. Please also let me know if I said something odd or if I should clarify anything, it's hard to put these things into words."

My parents both picked up shifts that there was no way out of. I‚Äôm home alone thinking of how alone and sad I am. This past year, I‚Äôve really gotten really sad and ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù. Reasons are that I‚Äôm a closeted gay just wanting acceptance from my family, I have only one friend who is starting to distance from me, the way I look, what I want to do with my life in the future, etc. It sucks. I‚Äôve been thinking that I really really want to come out recently and just be free. It‚Äôs such a huge burden to carry to keep in. Today is my 16th and I don‚Äôt want to hide anymore.

They say they‚Äôll love me endlessly and give me so much love and say they‚Äôll love me no matter what but they say that I have too many friends that are girls, I should make some guy friends, making flamboyant facial and hand movements is awkward.

She doesn‚Äôt sit with me at lunch anymore. She had drama with so much people that when I try to sit and talk with them, they talk behind my back. For no reason. I‚Äôve never done anything to them.

"Posted in the TransyTalk subreddit: How do you deal with self doubt?Hey everyone, So I've been wondering how everyone deals with self doubt? I feel like most trans people experience self doubt to some degree. Personally, it's been something I've had to deal with lately because I know my life would be easier if I stayed being male because society wouldn't have an issue with me but I know that ultimately years down the line, I would be more unhappy. I can't imagine a future where I'm male and *not* desperately unhappy. I know I'm trans but it's a case of society having so many expectations of what a trans person should be, let alone accepting us. I guess it's a case of having to say 'fuck you' to society's bullshit. What I wanna know is how do you deal with it? If anybody has any experience about how to reduce self doubt about whether you're 'really trans' in the eyes of society / how to deal with society's expectations of what being trans should 'look like' that would be great."

"Posted in the askgaybros subreddit: I just want to say thank you AGB,For being the most bigoted, racist, transphobic, hypocritical, judgmental group of people. **(For the select fraction of open minded people on this sub, I'm not talking about you, and I appreciate those who aren't like this.)** As a gay black feminine, flamboyant man myself, maybe it's easier for me to see through the bullshit, as opposed if I were another mold of a privileged person or category, I would be more oblivious, but whatever. Look, I'm all for no holds barred discussion. I know this is not a ""safe space"", but that doesn't mean this is a circlejerk (which you can go to that bullshit ass sub and talk to those assholes. I wouldn't be surprised if they crossposted this and added some unfunny commentary to it. smh.) and we can all be willy nilly to each other. Ignorance seems so bliss as of late. I don't know where it came from, but I'm not happy. There is a fine line between having unpolitical correct discussion, and just ignorance and hate. First off, I want to discuss a pink elephant in the room, and that's political left and right division between gay/bi and queer men. There was a post recently on this sub, about why are some gay/bi men Conservative/Republican/Trump Supporters, and I went into it under good faith, hoping to explore and learn something new. Nope, just a bunch of people giving their hypocritical political views. I could understand being conservative and right wing as a gay/bi man in the past. Hell, I can understand giving Trump and right wing views a chance several years ago, and voting for Trump last time several years ago, but it's for certain and blatantly clear that we don't belong even a centimeter over on that side, and they do not support us generally, it's time to give that up. That is however just my opinion. Next order of business, a lot of posts are being made on this sub of people saying they are banned from r/LGBT. Now, I've been banned from several LGBTQ subreddits (I'm not going to name which ones), but I've never been banned from r/LGBT. In my perspective, that sub is very positive and I've made several discussions on that sub when need be, and I was happy there and still happy there. My main thing is a lot of users on this sub are saying really nasty hurtful things about that subreddit, and these posts are highly upvoted and are like, ""Ugh, I don't want to see those ugly freaks post pictures of their transition anyways."" Shit like that is unacceptable, and we shouldn't be making statements like that. I'm not transgender, but as a gay black man, I support everyone in this community. We shouldn't be doing that at all. If anything, we as gay/bi/queer men should be embracing every shade of limelight in our community and culture. Ugh. In addition, in these dire political times, and these stressful situations we are under, it saddens me that I assumed this community would be just a tad more understanding and supportive. Topics including but not limited to; Health and pandemic issues, BLM, queer men of color, coming out and questioning, making friends, dating, culture clash and culture groups and cliques when it comes to friendships and dating, being disowned by family, femininity, drug abuse, promiscuity, sex positivity and safety, body shaming, ageism, mental illness and disability awareness, social justice, violence and discrimination, prejudice and identity politics, are all important, yet people here want to trash all of that, and don't care to listen, and voices need to be heard, and important matters are silenced. I don't get it. Also, I want to talk about how a lot of you guys are crossposting and hotlinking discussions from hate subreddits. These subreddits have been banned and removed several times for hate speech, yet you guys continue to merge and migrate discussions from this subreddit (which to my knowledge is not for hateful discussion, rather for education and dialogue) and it's getting on my fucking nerves. Stop it, and knock it off. Lastly, I'm getting scared that in turn this is also reflective of the gay/bi/queer male community now. If this is what people think online, I can imagine how people in gay liaisons and circuits in the real world believe. We are supposed to be getting better and more inclusive, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is becoming a mirror of how the community is at large. I don't know. I'm just praying for everything. That's all, I know some of the people I'm calling out in this post are gonna downvote this to oblivion, and that's fine. However, I just wanted to get my point across, and I'm sure people will understand where I'm coming from. I said what I had to say, and I'm finished. Thank you."

It's a never ending circle of pain. I have trouble explaining it. Nobody has the time or patience to help me figure out what's going on with me. I'm constantly feeling alone and down. I want it all to stop. I miss being that happy little girl with light in her eyes. I want that back. The semi-perfect life I had before was sweet and now I'm watching it crumble out of my grasp like sand. Please. Just one person show me that life isn't full of shit like this. I don't want to believe that this is life and that it'll never get better. Can someone in this world show me that I have reasons to still live. I don't want this anymore. This life, this pain, this lonliness. It hurts too bad."
